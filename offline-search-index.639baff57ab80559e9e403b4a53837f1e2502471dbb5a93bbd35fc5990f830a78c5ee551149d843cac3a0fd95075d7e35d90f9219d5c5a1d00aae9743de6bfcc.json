This UC calculates the RES generarion forecast\nComplete description\nRES generation forecasts are needed by different actors and for different purposes, among others: •\tFor bidding in the different energy markets •\tFor assessing the security of the transmission grid Each type of RES has its own forecasting algorithm and required inputs. For wind and solar generation, an accurate weather forecast is required. For hydro generation, besides weather forecast, it is also needed a forecasting of the water level in the reservoir, which may involve a modelling of the plant and historical data. Additionally, any RES production forecast should take into account the following: •\tOperational rules •\tScheduled maintenance periods The operational rules for the RES do not change very often and can be modelled in the forecasting algorithm (e.g. maximum wind speed that the windmill supports or scheduled stops to avoid shadow flickering) Scheduled maintenance periods cannot be predicted and thus there should be a procedure to agree and distribute information on these periods, in a request/approval scheme. The objective is that all the relevant actors are aware of the maintenance periods and these periods are taken into account in the calculation of the forecast. The role of the actor generating the forecast is the FORECASTING GENERATION CALCULATOR.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe main purpose of this HLUC is to describe how multi-vector local generation, on-site multi-vector storage and Building Management Systems (BMS) should interface with an Energy Management System (EMS) of a Local Energy System (LES) enabling optimized operation, through the integration of advanced functionalities provided by the E-LAND Toolbox.\nOptimal operation of a LES encompassing multi-vector DER generators (thermal or electrical); on-site multi-vector storage (i.e. electrical batteries, hot water tanks, hydrogen storage, building enthalpy) and load priority control facilitated by the BMS could achieve higher efficiency levels than traditional solutions. The integration with advanced tools e.g. forecasting, optimisation as well as to external sources of data (e.g. weather forecasts) - through an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - should provide enough information and endpoints for proper EMS automation scenarios to be enforced having as a goal the optimal operation of the Local Energy System (LES). Therefore, the integrations of various field equipment (e.g. storage controllers, DER controllers, actuators, sensors) and the BMS is crucial for the realization of these advanced operations.\nOptimal operation of a Local energy system (LES) can be considered from different perspectives (Facility Operator, Microgrid Operator, Aggregator, DER Owner) and therefore achieved by prioritising and/or optimising indices like: energy efficiency, cost of operation, cost of ownership, energy cost, carbon footprint.\nComplete description\nTraditionally, Energy Management System (EMS) solutions provide a comprehensive way of understanding energy profiles, identifying actual energy use and waste, as well as perform control actions on a variety of production and storage assets of multiple vectors (thermal, electrical, gas).\nHowever, in the case of a Local Energy System (LES) where multiple business actors with different roles exist (e.g. DER Owner/Producer, Consumer), an enhanced solution is required to provide a top-level view of the operation of the system, enabling the realisation of optimisation scenarios. On this basis, the integration of the EMS with the controllers of the various storage and production assets is necessary. On the other hand, the integration with Building Management Systems (BMS) allows a more in-depth knowledge of the facilities’ loads (electrical or thermal), taking priority based decisions and enabling fine grained Demand Response (DR) actions.\nOn top of that, the EMS can make use of advanced tools related to forecasting and optimal operational scheduling/ future planning, which combined with all the above can help achieve optimal utilization of the constrained grid capacities, maximizing the use of on-site RES, by utilizing multi-vector energy blending, storage and DR actions.\nSuch an integrated system can enable the operation of the LES with the following advanced features: • Coordinated DER operation • Control over the energy mix and optimal use of storage with energy forecasting • Increased system reliability and power quality • Optimal load prioritization and shifting • Microgrid enabled operations: the ability of all integrated systems to work together as a single system, enabling facilities to operate as autonomous microgrids; • Quantification and measurement of overall carbon foot-print • Detailed monitoring of real-time energy-related data • Alerts for optimizing operational expenditures (OpEx)\nThe enhanced EMS will encompass the integration of the following sub-systems: • EMS: integrating the traditional DER Owner energy monitoring and control solution; • DER Controllers: On-site devices offering monitoring \u0026amp; control of the production assets of DER Owners; • Storage Controllers (Thermal/Electric/H2) Devices for multi-vector storage management, handling information on capacity and availability of storage assets of DER Owners; • BMS: Offering a monitoring network at a building level (evaluate energy usage/needs, occupancy, production, weather, etc.) as well as assisting real-time, data-driven decisions for the optimization of the consumption, by analysing offering various modes of operation (demand response, store energy) for various vectors; • Field Devices: For sensing or actuation of various loads, integrated through the BMS or directly; • EV/FCEV Chargers: Devices enabling the monitoring and control of the charging of Electric Vehicles and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles in the LES, typically owned by the local stakeholders or even third parties • External Data Sources: for weather forecasting and energy prices • Advanced tools: for energy forecasting (Energy Forecaster) and for optimal scheduling (Optimal Scheduler) and planning • Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): A system enabling the integration of the above sub-systems\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe goal of this HLUC is to describe how optimal multi-vector operation of a LES can be achieved, by coordinating the different available assets; providing a solution to the optimal control problem of DER, flexible loads and different storage technologies. On the basis of these flexibility assets and considering the different energy networks (i.e. electricity, heat, gas, Hydrogen) the operator of the LES, aims to achieve specific goals related to the economic operation, reduce environmental impact and reduce the dependency from the main grid. The role of the LES operator can be undertaken by various actors such as: the Distribution System Operator (DSO), the Aggregator (e.g. Virtual Power Plant, EV Charging Infrastructure Owner/Operators), the Microgrid Operator, the Facility Operator; whilst the role of the flexibility provider can be handled by DER Owners i.e. the owners of generation and storage assets of various energy vectors – as well as Consumers and in general an aggregated scheme of the previous e.g. a Community within the LES.\nComplete description\nThe task of leveraging the multi-vector assets of a Local Energy System (LES) for achieving an optimized operation can be viewed by different perspectives. From the perspective of the operator of the grid, pursuing efficiency, reduce environmental impact and reliability; a task undertaken by an actor such as the Grid/Microgrid/Facility Operator. On the other hand, the optimal management of such resources can be leveraged by an Aggregator aiming to maximize its profits through market participation (VPP concept).\nThe assets involved in a multi-vector LES case concern various type of DERs (e.g. wind, PV, solar thermal), flexible loads (e.g. EVs, FCEVs, HVAC) and different storage technologies (i.e. electrical, thermal, H2). The (multi-vector) flexibility assets are assumed to be provided by the various DER owners and consumers, owned by individuals or the community within the LES. The flexibility providers procure services to the operator of the LES, in order to support the grid operation, improve the overall system efficiency and/or reduce the carbon emissions and are assumed to receive reimbursements respectively. The core functionalities of the optimal operation concern: • Demand side management and the shifting/scheduling of multi-vector loads (see PUC 2 Shift Building Loads using Demand Side Management, PUC 3 Shift Harbour Loads using Demand Side Management) • Optimal scheduling of different storage vectors: electric, thermal and hydrogen-based (see PUC 4 Optimal Scheduling of Thermal and Electrical Storage, PUC 5 Optimal Scheduling of Electrical Storage and Hydrogen Storage, PUC 6 Storing Excess Generation in Thermal Network ) • Optimal Management of EV/FCEV related operations: (see PUC 7 Optimal Management of EV with Hydrogen and/or Electricity) The above functionalities are facilitated by forecasting, scheduling and integration services provided by the relevant tools developed in the project.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope This HLUC targets at describing the concept of sizing of the production and storage assets of a LES in order to: - Lower cost of energy use, Maximize profits from selling energy to the grid, - Reduce C02 emissions, and - Increase self-supply.   Objective(s) Calculating the optimal sizing of different components of the LES, consisting of:     Electrical and thermal energy production Electrical and thermal energy storage Based on electrical and thermal loads consumption data, as well as energy interchange with the electricity and district heating grid. | | Related business case(s) | PUC8 Multi-vector Optimisation of assets’ sizing in a LES PUC9 Optimal sizing of electrical parts of a LES |  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe optimal sizing of a multi-vector LES involves the sizing of different assets, in order to make its operation more efficient. The assets may concern: • Electrical production assets, like PV panels and Wind generators • Thermal production assets such as solar thermal panel and geothermal heat pumps • Storage assets, such as batteries and hot water tanks Depending on the role of the involved business actor (grid/microgrid operator, facility operator, aggregator, DER owner), the business goals and relevant optimization objectives can vary. The optimization is proposed to tackle the following objectives:\n Cost reduction for energy use or profit maximization from market participation Fossil fuels/CO2 emissions reduction Grid dependency reduction The optimization process should enable the operator to model and possibly combine the different objectives of the involved actors. In order to perform the simulations, the availability and cost of thermal and electrical energy exchanged with the main grids is considered. High import cost and low export price will increase the need for reducing the dependency of the LES from the main grid.  Complete description\nA multi-vector local energy system (LES) operator can pursuit various goals, depending on its roles. Such goals may concern: • Increasing quality of service for load and production assets (any vector) • Increasing energy efficiency and reliability of the LES • Minimizing cost of operation • Reducing the environmental impact (CO2 emissions) • Maximizing the profits from selling energy to the market\nTo achieve such goals, the LES operator, can consider investments in local energy production (i.e. Distributed energy resources - DERs) such as PV panels, Wind generators, solar thermal panels and geothermal heat pumps. The former two technologies can increase the self-production of electricity and reduce electricity costs. Moreover, they can reduce peak power consumption or even provide revenues from selling energy to the energy market. From the two latter technologies, the local heat production can contribute in reducing the dependency from District Heat (DH) supplier or even become a heat producer and supply the grid with excessive production. Such assets can be installed in the operator facilities or in the facilities of consumers, which may be involved in the investment by leasing their properties or even investing in the assets. This way the role of DER Owners is considered to be in close collaboration with the operator that orchestrates the investment.\nFurthermore, investments in storage of electrical and thermal energy can be considered and designed in order to lower the costs of energy supply from the main grid (e.g. peak shaving), as well as improve the profitability of energy production (by optimizing the energy consumption or energy trading). In a similar manner, local consumers/producers may be involved in such investments.\nThe core functionalities of the optimal planning comprise the modelling of the various assets and objectives of the investor, as well as the various ownership schemes in order to identify the most efficient scenarios for future investments.\nFrom the perspective of an investor (e.g. a DER owner), the needs of electrical and thermal energy should be evaluated, integrating the current and estimating the future loads (from different vectors) as way to increase self-consumption. Also, the energy market for electrical (i.e. the local DSO and customers in the LES) and thermal energy (i.e. the DH supplier and the customers in the LES) should be investigated in terms of volume versus value, both for import and export. Assessing these inputs and providing the relevant optimisation criteria and assets of interest, the investor must be provided with the most beneficial scenarios with regard to the sizing of assets and the investment cost. The optimisation should concern different vectors and possible transformations of energy amongst them.\nA typical use case should model the optimal sizing of electrical assets for storage and production, considering the current assets and the future electrical loads of the LES, whilst also considering production and loads (through transformation e.g. HVAC for heating) from other vectors(see - PUC 11: Sizing of electrical parts of a LES). In this scenario, the pricing of each energy vector (e.g. electric, thermal, gas) during the day and throughout the year will be considered, along with the constraints regarding the autonomous operation of the LES, as well as other techno-economic constraints.\nFinally, another use case combining both electrical and heating production and storage assets, should enable the identification of the optimal investment in the LES (see PUC 07: Multi-vector Optimisation of assets’ sizing in a LES).\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Based on historical records, current load measures and weather forecast, it will be provided the total load forecast (consumption models) at a substation, primary or secondary, located at Kefalonia and Attica regions.   Objective(s) Provide input data to DSO in order to assess voltage levels and power flows at distribution network   Related business case(s) PUC12    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nPlaced within the abovementioned BUCs, PUC1 describes how the forecast provider extracts, transforms and loads (ETL) the data needed by the DSO to assess voltage levels and power flows. It is composed by four Secondary Use Cases (scenarios):\n Get measurement form substation Get meteo forecast Generation of load forecast KPI calculation for load forecast  Complete description\nThis PUC makes reference to the forecasting modules focused on the operation of the DSO and the distribution network. In order to increase the performance of these modules, data requests to external systems will be sent. Finally, the results of the algorithms will be available to external actors/applications.\nType of considered forecasts: •\tLoad Forecast: Forecast of total demand at a substation (primary or secondary).\nThe time-granularity/horizon of the forecast can be: •\tVery short-term: 1h (5 or 15 min steps), •\tShort-term: 24-48 h (15min-1hour step), •\tMedium-term: 48h-10days (1-hour step)\nThe PUC will deepen in the following steps that are necessary to forecast the total demand at a substation:\n Forecast Provider retrieves current load from substation. Forecast Provider asks for meteo forecast to Weather Forecast. Forecast Provider corrects wrong/missing data, using an algorithm for anomalies detection. Forecast Provider generates a mathematical model for load, using the historical data, and it applies the current load to the mathematical model, getting the load forecast. Forecast Provider sends the forecasts to DSO. DSO sends the forecasts to Coordinet platform (actors who need it for their activities).  Besides, KPIs related to accuracy of prediction will be calculated in order to get the efficacy of the forecast done.\nWithin the related business use cases, this primary use case, jointly with PUC2 (RES forecast in DN), focuses on the BUCs’ first step from DSO side:\nMore precisely, PUC1 is divided into four secondary use cases also referred to as scenarios:\n•\tSUC 1.1 – Get measurement from substation: The Forecast Provider asks for current load to the Substation, which returns that measure.\n•\tSUC 1.2 – Get meteo forecast: The Forecast Provider asks for the weather prediction to the Weather Forecast Provider, an external server which does not belong to Coordinet ecosystem. The request contains the moment of time to be considered, such as prediction for 1 hour by or 24 hours by. The response contains the weather forecasting for that moment.\n•\tSUC1.3 – Generation of load forecast: After correcting wrong/missing data, the Forecast Provider generates a model of load for a period of time, using weather forecast and historical data related to load. Once this model is prepared, the Forecast Provider uses the current measurement to generate its prediction.\n•\tSUC1.4 – KPI calculation for load forecast: The KPIs are calculated in order to determine if the prediction is good enough. This calculation is done considering the load prediction and the real load.\n1.5.

This UC is envisioned to deal with assets directly managed by the operator of the grid, while assets from other actors will be indirectly operated through De-mand Side Management (DSM) in UC 2.10 and UC 2.11. Any microgrid operator will have two simultaneous objectives when managing this kind of assets: • Keep quality of the supply • Minimize energy flows in and out of the microgrid (i.e. minimizing dependency on the external network and RES surplus, thus maximizing self-sufficiency) This use case describes how those assets can be operated in an optimal way, following these assumptions: • First schedule is optimized energy-wise (maximize self-sufficiency) • Technical constraints (I or V congestions) coming from that schedule are assessed, which may deviate the original schedule from its optimal\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis use case defines information exchanges between TSO, DSO, Flexibility Operators and Market Operator necessary for procurement of flexibility provided by distributed energy resources. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Flexibility Operator interacts both with TSO and DSO and it is necessary to validate coordination mechanism that will prevent double activation of the same service at the same time. TSO and DSO should also collaborate in order to avoid negative impact of DFR (Distributed Flexibility Resource) activation on their respective networks.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Three main scenarios should be considered:\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The Flexibility Operator provides services for the TSO (national flexibility market) and the DSO should validate, in day-ahead or intraday timeframes, the activation of these flexibilities (for the resources connected in distribution network)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The Flexibility Operator provides services for the DSO (local flexibility market). The DSO should provide, in day-ahead, the forecast load/generation for each primary substation including the activation of the procured flexibilities. The TSO should take into account this information for the balancing and congestion detection proposes.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The Flexibility Operator connected to distribution network provides services for the both for TSO and DSO in a coordinated local and national market mechanism. The offers not accepted in the local market are sent to the national market. At national market the TSO can obtain flexibilities from the Flexibility Operators connected on transmission and distribution networks.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The Flexibility Operator provides services for the both for TSO and DSO in a single procurement platform (single market). The activation of the offers should be agreed both by TSO and DSO.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\nComplete description\nFlexibility services can be used at the electricity market for the three types of actions: - portfolio optimisation of market players - constraints management in transmission and distribution networks (at day-ahead and intraday markets)- balancing to ensure power system security (balancing market). Enabling flexibility services must not lead to market fragmentation or competition distortion. However, settlement of constraint management and balancing must be clearly separated. DFR providers must be able to sell their services to both TSOs and DSOs. TSO procures flexibility services, from large industrial consumers or aggregators. DSO procures flexibilities also from aggregators and from several types of DERs (distributed generation, demand response, decentralized storage, electric vehicles) connected to the distribution grid with the purpose to maintain quality of service and the security of supply. DSO can procure flexibility services in long and short timescales. In the present BUC, the timeframes day-ahead and intraday are considered. Coordination between TSO and DSO is needed since the same flexibility resources may be activated for balancing (TSO services) and congestion constraints management (TSO and DSO services) purposes. Scenario 1: TSO procures the flexibilities and the DSO should validate their activationDFR are procured by TSO for the purpose of balancing or constraint management in the transmission grid. However, the activation of the flexibilities can jeopardizes the security of supply and reduces quality of services due to, for example, power line congestions, voltage constraints or overload the power transformer at TSO/DSO border. Since the DFR are connected to distribution network, DSO should be asked to validate the DFRs procured by the TSO to avoid constraints in the distribution system.Scenario 2: DSO procures the flexibilities and provides the forecasted load/generation by primary substationDSO can organises a local procurement of flexibilities to prevent the operation constraints in the distribution network. The constraints can be technical (HV/MV power transformer overload, lines congestion, voltage constraints) but also contractual (agreements between TSO/DSO in the TSO/DSO borders). Since the procurement of the DFR will impact the global system operation, the DSO should include the activation of the flexibility offers in the forecasts (load/generation by primary substation) sent to the TSO in day-ahead.Scenario 3: Coordination mechanism between local and national marketThe Flexible Operators connected in distribution network should place their offer in a local market and the Flexible Operators connected in the transmission network should place their orders in a national market. The clearing mechanism in local market should provide services for the DSO to solve the distribution network constraints. The offers that are not used in the local market should be technically validated by the DSO and be transferred for the National market. After the clearing process both in local and national markets, the TSO should coordinate the activation of the flexibilities connected in the transmission system and the DSO should coordinate the activation of the flexibilities connected in the distribution network.Scenario 4: TSO and DSO procure flexibility in a single flexibility marketTo ensure the market liquidity, building a level playing field for different service providers in a single marketplace and to joint procurement of services both for TSOs and DSOs a single procurement system is needed [1]. In this single procurement platform (market) the TSO and the DSOs should include their needs to balancing and congestion management (TSO) and for congestion and voltage management (DSO). It is important to mention that some voltage constraints can appear in distribution network even if a good reactive management is implemented.Flexibility platform enables well-structured and organised exchange of data between TSO, DSO and flexibility service provider. DSO should have visibility of aggregated resources in the distribution grid and information about individual activations. This information should be available (day ahead or intraday time frames) to ensure that market schedules are not in the conflict with network operation. \n1.5.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Market Operator Business The unique power exchange of trades for the actual delivery of energy that receives the bids from the parties that have a contract to bid. The market operator determines the market energy price for the market balance area after applying technical constraints from the system operator. It may also establish the price for the reconciliation within a metering grid area.    Flexibility Operator Business Role which links through contractual agreements (flexibility requests, notices etc.) the role customer and its possibility to provide flexibilities to the roles market and grid; generic role that could be taken by many stakeholders. This entity can activate all or part of the flexibility resources during a period and regarding a specific location or geographical area.    Distribution System Operator Business A natural or legal person responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of and, if necessary, developing the distribution system in a given area and, where applicable, its interconnections with other systems and for ensuring the long term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity or gas. That definition is provided for by art. 2 n. 6 Dir 2007/72/EC with regards to electricity and by art. 2 (6) Dir 2007/73/EC with regards to gas.In the electricity sector distribution means the transport of electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution systems with a view to its delivery to customers, but does not include supply according to art. 2 (5) Dir, 2007/72/EC. Accordingly, distribution in the gas sector means the transport of natural gas through regional pipeline networks with a view to its delivery to customers, but not including supply.DSOs have to act according to art. 25, 26, 27 Dir. 2007/72/EC (with regards to electricity) and to art. 25, 26, 27 Dir. 2007/73/EC (with regards to gas). The aforementioned provisions provide the tasks and duties of DSOs.One of the main characteristics of the DSO is that it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activities not relating to distribution within a vertically integrated undertaking. Unlike the transmission system operator, the DSO is not affected by ownership unbundling.    Transmission System Operator Business According to the Article 2.4 of the Electricity Directive 2009/72/EC (Directive): \u0026quot;a natural or legal person responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of and, if necessary, developing the transmission system in a given area and, where applicable, its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity\u0026quot;. Moreover, the TSO is responsible for connection of all grid users at the transmission level and connection of the DSOs within the TSO control area.Source : EU Commission Task Force for Smart Grids, EG3     3.2.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope The exchange of real time data/information in the observability area between TSO\u0026rsquo;s and DSO\u0026rsquo;s   Objective(s) Increase observability areas of both TSO and DSO on each other networks, expanding the set of signals (measurements, states …) exchanged in real-time, as well as improving data exchange structure/normalization. Enlarge real-time data exchanged between TSO and DSO for improved supervision and control of their own networks.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis SUC describes the process to define the exchange of signal/information (measurements, states, \u0026hellip; ) between the TSOs and DSOs. Two scenarios are described: one to send the real-time information and another to request the real-time information.\nComplete description\nThe exchange of real-time information between TSO and DSO is essential to real-time control and supervision of the power system. Although it is a usual practice between transmission and distribution operators, it should be revised and improved given the importance that has in the operation of both grids.The definition of the standardized method to request and send measurements along with setting up a methodology to define the right observability areas of both TSO and DSO at each other networks and by expanding the set of signals (measurements, states …) exchanged are some of the enhancements that this SUC provides.In the case of Portuguese field test, the exchange of real-time information will use Inter-Control center Communication Protocol (ICCP) in order to allow the communication between TSO and DSO SCADAs. However, other solutions can be adopted.\n1.5.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Data exchange platform System Platform used by several power system actors to exchange information for different proposes. Three types of data (real-time, scheduled and structural data) can be exchanged through this platform. The operational/control data are not included in real-time type. The exchange of information related with the markets are included in the scheduled data.The platform is a data-agnostic ICT infrastructure that enables a secure and reliable information exchange for different purposes (long-term planning, operational planning, contingencies, …) and within different time scales.    Network Operation System The Network Operation function includes business activity directly involved with monitoring and operating the power grid as a whole system. The phrase ‘directly involved’ indicates that the covered activities are limited to a hands-on focus on keeping the power grid running successfully, and more indirect influences on grid operation, such as energy markets, will be covered by other business functions.The phrase ‘as a whole system’ indicates that local activity, such as operating a generating plant or substation, is excluded, and here the concern is a system perspective, such as is typical in transmission or distribution control centres.In the presented SUCs, the Network Operation function can refer to either the analysis tools used by TSOs or DSOs.     3.2.

Customer Portals store data related to its services (e.g. authentication information, representation rights, access permissions, data logs).    Data Exchange Platform System Data exchange platform (DEP) is a communication platform the basic functionality of which is to secure data transfer (routing) from data providers (e.g. data hubs, flexibility service providers, TSOs, DSOs) to the data users (e.g. TSOs, DSOs, consumers, suppliers, energy service providers). DEP stores data related to its services (e.g. cryptographic hash of the data requested). The DEP does not store core energy data (e.g. meter data, grid data, market data) while these data can be stored by data hubs. Several DEPs may exist in different countries and inside one country.    DEP Operator Business Data exchange platform operator owns and operates a communication system which basic functionality is data transfer.     3.2.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Analysis for optimal automation and monitoring of MV/LV networks   Objective(s) Facilitate the selection of level of automation in terms of Quality of Service and investment.   Related business case(s)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nNowadays the operation of MV networks creates new challenges for automation. Coupling this with the worldwide economic situation, efforts for reaching a balance between Quality of Service indexes and investments in automation and grid reinforcement through simplify methods are worthy. This Use Case describes this process.\nComplete description\nWhy? Requirements for increasing the level of automation in actual MV networks are rising currently. The relation between investment in automation and Quality of Service it is not linear. For example, the location of the same number of devices could lead to a variety of costs as well. Moreover, initial investment plans might be not affordable due to the actual economic crisis. Therefore, a simulation program to evaluate different scenarios is proposed to select a compromised point between costs, number of equipment and propose criterion to locate them. What expectation? / When It is expected a definition of a methodology to decide the level of automation in MV grids in a simplify manner. It would be based on a simulation algorithm taking into account investment on equipment in different types of SS and lines, power reinforcements and evaluation of their impact on the Quality of Service (TIEPI). It is intended to facilitate decisions during the network planning phase fulfilling technical, cost and regulatory constraints. What occurs? The main three steps in the process are: Use average values of outages (for example rate of outages in SS, lines, cables\u0026hellip;) and cost units of work to install telecontrol equipment (cabinet at SS and breakers at lines) to increase the automation of the network. These data are managed by the DSO after analysing historical records collected in their systems. Simulation phase to evaluate different scenarios of outages over a simplified MV network portion Selection of compromise solution between cost and quality of service achieved\n1.5.

General remarks    General remarks     The hypotheses/conditions under which the Use Case is developed are the following: The analysed MV network area is divided in small sections. These sub-sections are selected between two consecutive automatic Secondary Substations (SS). A simplified MV network representation is required in PSS/E to simulate each outage scenario (power flow calculations) Average rates of outages are needed to know the network performance of each area to identified critical zones. These values would be for example per SS (outage/100SS/year), underground lines (outages/100km/year) and aerial lines (outages/100km/year). Regulatory values are used to decide objective targets for simulation (penalties due to QoS). Through the results (graph of QoS vs Investment) a criterion of location for pieces of control equipment (automatic cabinets and telecontrol breakers at lines) is proposed. The proposed level of automation is taking into account by the responsible of each control zone to install the equipment. In Spain the Distribution of electricity is a regulated activity. The remuneration of DSO is charged on customers through the Access Tariffs. This tax joins different concepts. One of them is devoted to cover, theoretically, the distribution activity. The value is decided by the Ministry. From 2008, all DSO are subjected to the same procedure and legal conditions. The remuneration is individually assigned to each DSO taking into account issues such as: incentives per Quality of Service improvements, incentives to reduce the losses, valuation of overcast, effects to cover the foreseen demand and geographical restrictions. Each four (4) year the base value is fixed while yearly some parameters are corrected depending on the DSO performance. The architecture developed in the following section corresponds to the Use Case implementation within a DSO system architecture. However, in the PRICE pilot the approach has been simpler.    2.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Network Operation Statistics and Reporting  This actor makes it possible to archive on-line data and to perform feedback analysis about system efficiency and reliability. In the pilot this actor represents the fact of having already average ratios of outages. One possible way to get these values is to analyse historical outages tickets (normally in the DMS- Distribution Management Systems) where information about the outages are stored (start/end times, equipment that failed, power shortage, number of client affected\u0026hellip;)   Network Operation Simulation  This actor performs network simulations in order to allow facilities to define, prepare and optimise the sequence of operations required for carrying out maintenance work on the system (release/clearance orders) and operational planning. In the pilot this actor represents the fact of performing simulations with electrical tools. These analyses consist on evaluating scenarios with different level of automation.   Asset Investment Planning  Asset investment planning involves strategy definition and prioritisation, maintenance strategy planning, risk management, programme management and decision-making. It drives the condition, configuration, performance, operating costs, and flexibility of the asset base, with the aim of maximising value. In the pilot this actor represents the process of analysing the result of the simulation (a curve of QoS vs Investment)    3.2.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Übergeordnetes Ziel des Hauptarbeitspakets ist es, die Nutzung vorhandener Standards im Projekt durch Bereitstellung von Methodenwissen und Software-Werkzeugen zu fördern und die Projektergebnisse zur Weiterentwicklung von Standards aufzubereiten. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt wird dabei auf das Thema Informationssicherheit inkl. IT-Sicherheit und Datensicherheit sowie den Datenschutz gelegt.\nIn diesem Use Case geht es zum einen um die einheitliche Darstellung aller Use Cases des Projektes enera mit Hilfe des Use Case Tempates, deren Sammlung, Verknüpfung und Konsolidierung untereinander sowie der Bereitstellung für weitere Arbeiten durch ein Use Case Management Repository (UCMR). Zum anderen wird soll aufbauend auf den Use Cases eine Gesamtübersicht über das Projekt enera als Architekturdokumentation im Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) entstehen.\n   Objective(s) Use Cases erfassen Use Cases im UCMR sammeln Bereitstellung Use Cases Pflege Use Cases Erstellung SGAM Komponentenebene Erstellung SGAM Gesamtarchitekur   Related business case(s)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nDie konzeptionellen Aktivit\u0026auml;ten in enera werden durch die Erstellung von Anforderungs- und Architekturmodellen zusammengef\u0026uuml;hrt. Dabei werden nationale und internationale Standards und technische Richtlinien (u. a. von DKE, IEC, ISO, IEEE, BSI) und gesetzliche Vorgaben ber\u0026uuml;cksichtigt.\nDas Ziel dieses Use Cases ist die Architekturdokumentation nach SGAM inkl. eines Repositorys mit den enera Anwendungsf\u0026auml;llen gem\u0026auml;\u0026szlig; IEC 62559. Dies l\u0026auml;sst sich in drei Teile untergliedern:\n Erstellung der enera Anwendungsf\u0026auml;lle gem\u0026auml;\u0026szlig; IEC 62559 Sammlung der Anwendungsf\u0026auml;lle in einem Repository Erstellung der Gesamtarchitektur im SGAM  Complete description\nDas IEC 62559-2 Use Case Template dient der einheitlichen Beschreibung von Anforderungen an Smart Grid-Systemen. Das Template wird mittlerweile auf andere Systeme wie z.B. Ambient Assisted Living und Electrical Vehicles adaptiert und zeigt damit, dass es auch f\u0026uuml;r andere Systeme ohne gro\u0026szlig;e Anpassungen verwendet werden kann. Basierend auf dem Use Case lassen sich Architekturmodelle (wie z.B. SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model) und EMAM (Electric Mobility Architecture Model)) erstellen, die f\u0026uuml;r die weitere Entwicklung eines Systems relevant sind und damit einen Schritt nach der Anforderungsbeschreibung mittels Use Cases darstellen.\nDas Use Case Management Repository (UCMR) ist eine beim OFFIS entwickelte Webapplikation f\u0026uuml;r die Erstellung, das Management und den Austausch von Use Cases sowie weiteren zugeh\u0026ouml;rigen Daten wie Architekturmodelle, Akteurs- und Anforderungsbibliotheken. Zur Strukturierung der Inhalte von Use Cases wird eine Baumstruktur zur Visualisierung angewandt, die derzeit in vier Ordner unterteilt ist: Use Cases, Actors (Akteure), Functions (Funktionen) und Requirements (Anforderungen). Der Use Case Ordner zeigt die Use Cases, die von den Nutzern erstellt wurden. Jeder Use Case kann in einem eigenen Tab ge\u0026ouml;ffnet werden und seine Szenarien und Szenarioschritte werden im Baum angezeigt. Die Elemente des Actors-, Functions- und Requirements-Ordners k\u0026ouml;nnen ebenfalls in Tabs ge\u0026ouml;ffnet werden; Zus\u0026auml;tzlich k\u0026ouml;nnen diese Elemente im Baum sortiert und verlinkt werden. Der Vorteil dieser Ordnerstruktur ist die Wiederverwendung von Elementen, beispielsweise kann ein Akteur einmalig definiert und dann in mehreren Use Cases verwendet werden.\nDas Smart Grid Architektur Modell (SGAM), das im Rahmen der Bearbeitung des EU-Mandats M/490 entwickelt wurde, dient der Konzeptualisierung von Smart Grids. Es erlaubt die Pr\u0026uuml;fung von Smart Grid Anwendungsf\u0026auml;llen und deren Unterst\u0026uuml;tzung durch Standards. So kann die Unterst\u0026uuml;tzung von Anwendungsf\u0026auml;llen durch die SGAM-Methodik verifiziert beziehungsweise L\u0026uuml;cken identifiziert werden. Mit dem Modell kann der aktuelle Stand einer Implementierung im elektrischen Netz dargestellt werden, wobei die Smart Grid Anwendungsf\u0026auml;lle aus architektonischer Sicht betrachtet werden und das SGAM spezifisch und neutral in Hinblick auf Umsetzung und Technologie ist. Dar\u0026uuml;ber hinaus kann die Entwicklung hin zu zuk\u0026uuml;nftigen Smart Grid Szenarios geschildert werden, da das Modell den Prinzipien der Universalit\u0026auml;t, Lokalisierung, Konsistenz, Flexibilit\u0026auml;t, Skalierbarkeit, Erweiterbarkeit und Interoperabilit\u0026auml;t folgt. Das SGAM wird auf drei Achsen beschrieben. Bei der Modellierung wird auf f\u0026uuml;nf Interoperabilit\u0026auml;tsebenen jeweils die Smart Grid Fl\u0026auml;che abgedeckt, die durch die elektrischen Dom\u0026auml;nen mit der klassischen Energieflusskette und die Zonen des Energiemanagements mit der hierarchischen Struktur aufgespannt wird.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope A local energy community - With the new Clean Energy Package, private households are encouraged not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical developments and grid fee mechanisms canmotivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly large installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency up to 100%.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) -\tMaximize consumption of local generation/Minimize demand satisfied by public grid  -\tIslanding of local grid by making use of flexible loads and storages  -\tMaximizing duration of islanding operation -\tUC 1 is prerequisite for UC 2 to 4   Related business case(s) no    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe use case “Islanding” of an energy community aims to balance generation and demand of a local energy community in such a way that the load flow across the connecting MV/LV transformer is reduced to a minimum. The balancing is enabled by an energy management systems called Avacon Local Flex Controller (ALF-C). The ALF-C monitors the power flow across the transformer and controls a battery energy storage system (BESS) connected directly to the LV-terminal of the substation. Generated energy surplus will be stored in the BESS and released at times of a generation deficit. Private households equipped with batteries and controllable electric heaters can be dispatched to increase the degree of self-sufficiency further.\nComplete description\nThe Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, encourages private households are not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share self-generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical development and grid fee mechanisms can motivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. This will lead to a change in the behaviors of electrical energy exchange along the grid connection point of the MV/LV grid and consequently load flows along the MV-lines. A local Energy Management System (EMS) named (Avacon Local Flex Controller –( ALF-C) will monitor local generation, demand and storage capacities and control available flexibilities in such a way that consumption of locally generated energy will be maximized. When local generation exceeds local demand, surplus energy will automatically be stored in local storages and the consumption of available flexible loads will be increased. When local consumption is exceeding local generation, stored electrical energy in local batteries will be discharged. The target is to minimize the load flow exchange at the MV/LV grid connection to a level at which the community is virtually islanded. In cases where generation and demand can not be balanced due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the residual load will exported/imported. A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases between the medium voltage and low voltage grid. The measured values indicate the residual demand or export of surplus of generated energy/power. Data is provided to the EMS an based on the information increases or decreases the load in order balance the grid. Additionally, customer households provide flexible load and storage capacities for steering. Flexible assets in the field are equipped with sensors and controllers for steering to increase or decrease demand and to command charging or discharging of local large Battery Energy Storage System and private customer household storages. Vendors of flexible assets provide a cloud data management platform from which measurement data are accessible for EMS via an backend. The interface also provides data to sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and provide the necessary data for EMS to estimate the state of charge of batteries or flexible loads and potential available storage capacity. With Hhistorical measurement data and weather forecasts provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize self-sufficiency. Controllers Actuators enable EMSC to switch on and off, increase or decrease energy consumption of individual loads, such as storage heaters and heat pumps, and storages located in private households and the large scale storage located in the community. The communication between sensors, actuators controllers and EMSC will be web based, via LTE or DSL and open protocols. Customers shall not sacrifice comfort due to a decrease of room heating. The operation of the community in an “Island” mode will be initiated by the operator.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration.   Related business case(s) Integration of local energy communities in network management strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the community to provide flexibility to third parties – driven by technical circumstances or following economic considerations (market incentives). Use Case 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant non-zero power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.\nComplete description\nThe community is consuming and/or generating energy. A user (in the case of the field trial the DSO) triggers the EMS to apply Use Case 2 and sets a target value (P’Breaker) for the power exchange at the grid connection. The EMS (ALF-C) processes weather forecasts and measurement values from the grid connection and flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads located in the community. Based on the data and historic values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach (P’Breaker) by utilizing the available flexibility to keep the power flow constant for a pre-defined duration.  The EMS communicates with sensors through the Blockchain Access Platform and DSO Technical Platform and handles all data in a dedicated data base. The DSO Technical Platform provides encryption and decryption in the whole IT infrastructure. Control signals are routed through the DSO technical platform and the Blockchain Access Platform to flexible devices, if applicable through a third-party backend that connects to the hardware.\n1.5.

These communities are unlikely to meet their own needs with locally generated energy throughout the year and will potentially run into energy-deficit in times of low local generation. Energy deficits could be compensated by the supplying distribution network. To reduce the stress on the mid-voltage feeder and reduce overall network cost, energy deficits occurring could be forecasted and delivered in discrete packages ahead of time at fixed time slots and be stored in local storages until demand arises.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).  In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur, they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising. Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.\nComplete description\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.

In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times.

Outside of the defined periods of energy export, no power exchange shall take place, according to DE-UC1.

The schedule can be defined for a duration for the next 1 to 24 hours.  The schedule contains time slots for the export of energy in which P’Breaker ≠ 0 and time slots in which no power shall be exchange along the grid connection point (P’Breaker = 0), following the principle of UC 1. During the application of UC 4 the total amount of exported energy shall meet the total amount of the residual energy surplus that the community will generate. The generated surplus will therefore have to be forecasted by the user. In times P’Breaker = 0 the generated surplus will have to be stored in local battery energy storages systems. In times P’Breaker ≠ 0, local batteries will be triggered to discharge in order to export generated surplus from LV into MV grid. To maintain the given setpoint P’Breaker deficits shall be covered by energy provided by batteries located in the local network whereas generated surplus shall be buffered in available batteries.  After the user input has been confirmed the EMS begins with the application of UC 4. The EMS receives weather forecasts provided by an external service provider and measurement values provided by sensors located at the LV/MV grid connection point, flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads as well as household grid connection points. Based on the received data and historic measurements values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach and maintain the setpoint schedule by utilizing the available flexibility for the pre-defined duration.  A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases with the MV grid PBreaker and provide data to the EMS. Based on the information the EMS determines deviations between PBreaker and P’Breaker and dispatches setpoints to increases or decreases the load in the grid in order to reach P’Breaker. Additionally, sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and SOC/SOE of storages and provide data to the EMS. With historical measurement data and weather forecast provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize the duration of time of maintaining P’Breaker.  In cases generation and demand cannot be balanced to reach (P’Breaker) due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the use case will be terminated.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description The UC investigates the capability of the state estimation tool to filter the available measurement data, comprising actual measurements obtained from active metering devices and pseudo-measurements, i.e. data derived from load forecasting or RES scheduling for network observability accomplishment, in order to identify measurements with gross errors (bad data), to suppress measurement errors, to reconcile inconsistent data and, ultimately, to estimate the actual operational network state.\nComplete description The DSO operates the distribution network. A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA) installed throughout the network, is available for real-time operation purposes. The related measurements refer to power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is the integration of measurement data obtained from PMUs into the State Estimation tool.   Objective(s) * To reinforce network observability and controllability via improved state estimation performance. * To ensure smooth incorporation of synchronised measurement data derived from PMUs into the preexisting system of conventional measurements.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Measurement data obtained from the installed PMUs are integraded in the State Estimation tool and used to enhance the network observability. The installation of PMUs at selected buses is sure to upgrade the overall metering infrastructure of the network, since they record synchronized measurements of bus voltage phasors as well as a number of line current phasors—all of which are independent of each other and count as individual measurements. Yet, their proper utilization via the SE tool is a challenging task due to a) the intense discrepancies in update rates between conventional and PMU measurements, b) the provision of current measurements which often lead to various numerical problems, and c) the contrast between the large weighting factors linked to PMU measurements compared to the much lower ones linked to pseudo-measurements, which usually raises ill-conditioning issues. The goal is to ensure that the integration of PMU data will be smooth and all the aforesaid problems will be circumvented.\nComplete description A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA, PMUs) installed throughout the network, is available to the DSO for real-time operation purposes. The aforementioned data refer to a) synchronised measurements of bus voltage phasors and line current phasors (magnitude and angle) and b) conventional measurements of power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set, reconciles the PMU data with the conventional measurements, and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses. Given the successful integration and use of the PMU data in the SE tool, the overall performance of the SE tool will be enhanced; the network state will be calculated with increased precision compared to conventional-measurements-only scenarios (uc-GR-1), and high quality real-time operational standards for distribution management applications will be met.\n1.5.

State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the state vector that the state estimation tool produces using the available measurements and the topology data from the AMR, GIS, SCADA and PMUs. The DSO communicates network tariffs in a day-ahead context. These tariffs appropriately reflect the potential of the network exceeding its physical limits resulting in violations and/or curtailment of demand/generation. Compared to the business as usual scenario of the flat network tariffs, the DSO aims at reducing such negative effects by the use of variable day-ahead network tariffs, which incentivise the appropriate actions of the -assumed as- rational users of the distribution network.\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is to examine the integration and operational use of low cost PMUs in order to increase network observability collecting measurement data such as voltage, current and phases in various points of the distribution network. More in detail, the DSO will use the data collected to improve the operation of the tools and services developed within the project by exploiting increased data granularity. Furthermore, the data coming from various sources and systems of the DSO should be integrated in the DSO Technical Platform having first passed through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to provide data access security and data integrity. In addition, all the available data should be further delivered for use by tools and services developed in order to support flexibility mechanisms. All the appropriate communication protocols should be integrated and tested to develop a unique point of data delivery to various actors involved in the project and a User Interface (UI) should be developed to allow the DSO personnel to use the available tools and services.   Objective(s) * To increase network observability.  * To integrate data coming from different sources in the DSO Technical Platform.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description PMUs are installed in critical network nodes to increase network observability. PMU measurements along with other DSO data (network topology, customer loads, etc) are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform to be visulalised in a User Interface (UI), so that DSO can make use of tools and services developed in the project. Aforementioned data is going through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to ensure data access security and data integrity.\nComplete description\nThe DSO operates the distribution network and handles the data sources coming from various systems such as SCADA/DMS, AMR, GIS etc. Data coming from various sources get integrated into the Open DSO Technical Platform providing an adequate level of network observability. Low cost PMUs are deployed in Mesogia area in critical network points and nodes where there is limited observability or a requirement to have an increased awareness such as DER and prosumers bidirectional power flows. Also, PMU data are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform following a data collection plan that serves the functionalities of the flexibility tools and services. Measurements from PMUs enhance network awareness in terms of data granularity and number of nodes observed in a cost effective manner. Also, the open DSO Technical Platform performs the correlation of the data coming from different sources and systems during real time, providing to the DSO the technical capacity for flexibility mechanisms support and a User Interface (UI) where the aforementioned is visualised.

The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nIn the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n Detection of voltage violations on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions; Definition of voltage violations on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid; Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders. At this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market.\nThe same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility. For the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges In the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n  Detection of congestion issues on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions;\n  Definition of congestion issues on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid;\n  Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.\n  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders.\nAt this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market. The same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility.\nFor the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

Objective(s) This information is needed to perform correctly algorithms (State Estimation, State Forecasting, Optimal Power Flow, and control actions in order to increase the network reliability and performance.  Related business\ncase(s)      1.4 Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe data collection for the LV grid is performed storing real-time measurements (mean values and PQ indexes), states and alarms in a unique repository – located in the Secondary Substation – after managing some implementation issues, such as protocol conversion and writing of data into the SSAU.RDBMS.\n“Real-time” in this context means something in between 1 second and some minutes.\nComplete description\nOn the LV grid, several monitoring devices will be installed:\n Smart Meters (SM) on the connection point of LV customers/productions. Data of SMs are often collected by a Meter Data Collector (MDC) system, installed in the secondary substation and aggregated in an Automatic Metering Management system (AMM) located in the control center.   Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Power Quality Meters (PQMs) or – more in general – Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  Data considered by the use case is:\n  Mean values of V, I, Q, P:\n  LV busbars, LV side of transformers and LV lines in secondary substations (RTU, IED)\n  On the connection point of LV customers/productions (SM/MDC)\n    Load profiles from LV customers and generations (SM/MDC)\n  PQ indexes both from the secondary substations and from some relevant nodes of the LV grid, such has street cabinets (PQM)\n  Status of remote-controllable elements in secondary substations (RTU-IED)\n  breakers/disconnectors\n  tap changer of MV/LV transformers\n  voltage or reactive power set-points for generation connected on the LV network\n    Alarms related to events and faults (IED-PQM-RTU)\n  Measures, events and states not provided by those devices are provided by the Distribution Management System (DMS).\nMeasures, events and states from the MV side of the secondary substation should be considered as well. In that case they will be transfer to the primary substation by the DMS.\nMeasures are fetched by using:\n  the IEC61850 protocols (mainly MMS) and stored into the database which presents a data model compliant with the IEC61850 for the general monitoring of the LV grid (from RTUs, IEDs, DMS…)\n  DLMS/COSEM protocol for the communication with electronic meters(EM)\n   Protocol conversion have to be implemented before writing the data – collected from different sources – into the SSAU.RDBMS to enable the execution of other use cases.\nThe SSAU.RDBMS should contain a Data layer, composed by a relational database, where the data are written.\nThe SSAU.Monitoring must include an Interface layer which implements required communication protocols and which is able to extract data from other systems.\nThe SSAU.Reporting is composed of an Application layer, which analyses the data to:\n  calculate statistical values such as min, max, avg, std, etc.\n  generate reports for the primary substation/DMS\n  1.5 General Remarks 2 Diagrams of Use Case Diagram 1   Diagram 2   Diagram 3   -- 3 Technical Details 3.1 Actors   Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case    DIED.SM function Smart Meter (SM)\nDef. 1\nMeter with additional functionalities one of which is data communication.\nDef. 2\nThe metering end device is a combination of the following meter-related functions from the Smart Metering reference architecture: Metrology functions including the conventional meter display (register or index) that are under legal metrological control.

Step by Step Analysis of Use Case 4.1. Overview of Scenarios    No. Scenario Name Primary Actor Triggering Event Pre-Condition Post-Condition     1         Notes This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.\n Primary Actor - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin. Triggering Event - the incident causing the scenario to begin. Pre-Condition - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed. Post-Condition - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.  4.2.
