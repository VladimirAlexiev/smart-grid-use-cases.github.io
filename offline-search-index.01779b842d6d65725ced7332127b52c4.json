Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Increasing renewable penetration causes violation of standard voltage bands on MV lines. The main scope of EACL-HU-01 is to mitigate voltage variations of MV feeders by activating flexibility services.   Objective(s) The objective of the use case is to keep actual voltage values of MV feeders within the standard bands.   Related business case(s) EACL-HU-02    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nNeed: Due to the proliferation of PV plants, connected to DSO MV lines or directly to the MV side of HV/MV substations, violation of standard voltage bands on MV lines is a forecoming issue in Hungary. This technical issue can be mitigated by P and/or Q on MV level. Service: Voltage issues of MV feeders can be mitigated by P and/or Q injection/consumption.\nComplete description\nThe BUC operates on two time horizons, each related to the specified grid service: •\tcapacity auction •\tand energy activation (scheduled), respectively. Capacity auctions will be driven by technical needs of the DSOs, which are determined on a weekly basis based on weekly maintenance plans. Gate opens at W-1 Monday 0:00 and closes at W-1 Friday 14:00, thus enabling bidders a fairly long time to place bids, but the market can be cleared during working hours on W-1. Results of the auction are to be published by W-1 Friday 15:00.\nEnergy bids can be submitted between W-1 Monday 0:00 and D-1 6:00. The early gate opening supports the procurement of services that are expected to be necessary with probability. The gate closure on D-1 allows SOs to procure services based on day-ahead predictions and network calculations. Results of the clearing are to be published by D-1 7:00, which is 60 minutes ahead of local daily balancing capacity market gate closure, and well before the active period of DAM market bidding. This allows market players to participate on flexibility and day-ahead markets separately, and also supports that uncleared flexibility bids are submitted to shorter horizon markets (DAM, BAM).\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope The description of prequalification of resources (DER) to participate in the flexibility market represented by Flexibility Platform (FP)   Objective(s) To register DER in the Flexibility Register (FR), which will enable the submission of bids on FP and participation in the flexibility market   Related business case(s) Prerequisite for other BUC    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe use case describes the prequalification process of DERs introduced by Flexibility Service Provider (FSP) to be registered in Flexibility Register. This registration is the prerequisite to participate in flexibility market processes on FP. The DER can be based on generation resources, energy storage and consumption (households, SMEs and industrial enterprises). The FSP can own one or more DERs or can be an aggregator which aggregates several DERs in its portfolio (called as FSPA)\nComplete description\nScenario 1 –FSP prequalification:\n•\tMarket prequalification Description: FSP registers itself on FP as natural or legal person In details it contains: o\tThe statement of legal and financial status o\tThe confirmation of access to FP (rules, RODO confirmation etc.) o\tThe declaration of the entire volume The status of FSP (pending) is registered in FR\n•\tCertification of DER\nDescription: Declaration of DER or DERs FSP declares its flexibility potential ready to provide services. In details it contains: o\tThe declaration of DERs and their technical characteristics o\tThe statement of connection point for each DER (PoC), its location and metering data availability The status (pending) of FSP and DERs are registered in FR\n•\tSO to which DER is connected confirms the right status of DER, its connection, location and availability of metering data. It is done for each DER declared by FSP. SO confirms location for each DER by assigning it to the TSO-DSO coupling point. In the case of incorrect assignment, SO makes an appropriate correction. The status (pending) of each DER associated with FSP is reported in FR.\n•\tProduct prequalification Description: Based on the list of available products published by FP, FSP decides on the bases of which products it is going to provide flexibility services.\n•\tFP checks whether the characteristic of DER fits with the characteristic of the chosen product. FP executes the automatic comparison of both characteristics: the products and DER or DERs managed by FSP. In case of positive checking, FP registers the DER or DERs allocated to the FSP in FR as qualified for the product in question. In case of mismatch, the message is sent to FSP and request for prequalification is rejected. It is done for each selected products.\n•\tFP requires from FSP additional actions and confirmation in case of balancing products. There are additional requirements and procedures related to balancing products, in particular FSP should operate in the balancing market through a balancing service provider (BSP) or obtain this status itself. For specific products some tests confirming compliance with the requirements may be required. When the FSP fulfils these requirements, the result is reflected in the FR, confirming a positive product prequalification.\n•\tStatic grid prequalification Description: FP, in the grid prequalification process, initiates the process asking all impacted SOs to check if the activation of DER under consideration can be accepted i.e. does not violate grid security limits. The responsible SO assesses and decides the outcome of the grid prequalification process. If no, and DER is not divisible, the DER is rejected and message regarding DER rejection in the grid prequalification process is sent to the FSP. If no, and DER is divisible, the FP reduces the capacity to the limit set by SO and informs (sends the message to) the FSP that the DER is registered in FR, but with the capacity limit. If yes, the status of DER (qualified) is registered in the FR. The static grid prequalification is performed for the most critical separately up and down products among those selected by FSP that may cause network congestion. The status of FSP (registered) is registered in the FR.\nEnd\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope The scope of BUC covers the use by the distribution system operator (DSO) of the service providers' active power capabilities to eliminate congestion and voltage violations in the distribution network. The services would be purchased using an IT Flexibility platform on market condition   Objective(s) • Elimination of congestion in the distribution network using active power   • Elimination of voltage violations in the distribution MV and LV network, using active power    • Coordination of TSO and DSO activities in the field of congestion management and voltage control    Related business case(s) EACL-PL-01 Prequalification,   EACL-PL-02 Balancing     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nScenario 1 This scenario describes actions that need to be performed as a first for acquiring services from the market. It focuses on the bidding process for the congestion management and voltage control for DSOs needs in the cases of day ahead auctions and medium term auctions. In both cases procedure is the same. The difference is in the timeline of each step. In the case of the medium term auction, DSO in the first step pays for the capacity from FSP for the selected period of time and in case of activation, DSO pays for the energy. In the case of the bids selected in the Day ahead auctions, DSO pays for the energy,\n•\tSelection/Bidding Description: The process of selecting offers from the market to solve the DSO problem related to network congestion or voltage violations with the use of active power management. The DSO opens an auction with detailed information about the location affected by the problem and providing all the required parameters to receive offers. Offers are submitted by FSPs who have successfully passed the prequalification process. Before selecting an offer, network analyses are performed, which eliminates offers that have a negative impact on the operation of the DSO network reporting the need or others DSOs. In detail, it includes: o\tDSO calls the auction on the Flexibility Platform for an action related to active power change for a strictly defined network area for the congestion or voltage violations as a result of the event in the network. The triggering event will be different for the day ahead auctions and the medium term auctions. o\tFlexibility Platform informs FSPs about the new need for service from the DSO side and the appearance of the auction. Flexibility platform collects all bids submitted within the specified by DSO time frame o\tThe MOL stack is created o\tCollected offers are analysed in terms of the possibility of solving a network problem, taking into account the impact on networks of others DSOs (in the case under consideration and in the specific network operation state) o\tChoosing the optimal offers o\tBased on analysis an offer / offers that allow to remove congestion or solve voltage problems from the network are selected. o\tThe selected offer or offers are stored by the flexibility platform, then dispatched the day before delivery and added to the group of offers sourced in the day-ahead process.\nComplete description\nThe process carried out on the Flexibility Platform in day-ahead time frame consists of the following steps: Scenario 1 – Determination of TSO needs in terms of capacity •\tEvery morning TSO also announces information on the constraints in the network. •\tThe Flexibility Platform Operator (FPO) takes the above-mentioned information from TSO and makes it available as soon as possible on the Flexibility Platform to interested parties. •\tEvery morning the Flexibility Platform may also make available information on the constraints in the distribution network that may affect the technical feasibility of potential offers for balancing capacity products and balancing energy.\n1.5.

Overview of Scenarios    No. Scenario Name Scenario Description Primary Actor Triggering Event Pre-Condition Post-Condition     1 Selection/Bidding for mid-term and day-ahead Based on the results of network analyzes the DSO identifies the problem with congestion or voltage violation in the distribution network as a result of the specific event. In the case of scheduled works, it can be . specific network configuration, preventing the execution of the planned work. For the day ahead operational the cause of the network problem may be related to deviation in the forecast or some network failure that has an impact on the grid configuration. The DSO decides to launch an auction in order to take advantage of the available sources of flexibility in the market to guarantee that the correct grid operation during normal operational and planned work is under consideration. The auction is launched a day ahead or several weeks in advance for planned works and concerns active power control activity by customers connected to specific locations in the distribution network for which problems have been identified. In case of medium term auctions launched for planned works, DSO contracts capacity and energy from FSP. One of the key elements is coordination between DSO and TSO in the field of contracting bids for CM and balancing. Coordination is needed so that the actions of one party do not cause problems for the other party. Thanks to the coordination of activities, it is also possible to obtain an optimal solution in economic terms (solving balancing and CM problems using the same offers).  Selection/Bidding for mid-term and day-ahead     2 Delivery for DSO Activation and delivery of the offer by a strictly defined FSPs resource under the previously contracted offer for the DSO. After contracting the offer under scenario 1, the DSO performs the final assessment of the feasibility of planned work and the legitimacy of using the offer. After the final confirmation of the necessity to activate the offer for medium term auctions, the DSO sends information to the platform operator about the commencement of activation of the contracted offer. Based on the information received from the platform operator, the FSP activates his resource and provides the service following the contracted offer. The DSO supervises the execution of the offer by the client in real-time.  Delivery for DSO     3 Settlement Market platform operator collects all data that are necessary to create an invoice for the provided services.

This UC calculates the RES generarion forecast\nComplete description\nRES generation forecasts are needed by different actors and for different purposes, among others: •\tFor bidding in the different energy markets •\tFor assessing the security of the transmission grid Each type of RES has its own forecasting algorithm and required inputs. For wind and solar generation, an accurate weather forecast is required. For hydro generation, besides weather forecast, it is also needed a forecasting of the water level in the reservoir, which may involve a modelling of the plant and historical data. Additionally, any RES production forecast should take into account the following: •\tOperational rules •\tScheduled maintenance periods The operational rules for the RES do not change very often and can be modelled in the forecasting algorithm (e.g. maximum wind speed that the windmill supports or scheduled stops to avoid shadow flickering) Scheduled maintenance periods cannot be predicted and thus there should be a procedure to agree and distribute information on these periods, in a request/approval scheme. The objective is that all the relevant actors are aware of the maintenance periods and these periods are taken into account in the calculation of the forecast. The role of the actor generating the forecast is the FORECASTING GENERATION CALCULATOR.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe main purpose of this HLUC is to describe how multi-vector local generation, on-site multi-vector storage and Building Management Systems (BMS) should interface with an Energy Management System (EMS) of a Local Energy System (LES) enabling optimized operation, through the integration of advanced functionalities provided by the E-LAND Toolbox.\nOptimal operation of a LES encompassing multi-vector DER generators (thermal or electrical); on-site multi-vector storage (i.e. electrical batteries, hot water tanks, hydrogen storage, building enthalpy) and load priority control facilitated by the BMS could achieve higher efficiency levels than traditional solutions. The integration with advanced tools e.g. forecasting, optimisation as well as to external sources of data (e.g. weather forecasts) - through an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) - should provide enough information and endpoints for proper EMS automation scenarios to be enforced having as a goal the optimal operation of the Local Energy System (LES). Therefore, the integrations of various field equipment (e.g. storage controllers, DER controllers, actuators, sensors) and the BMS is crucial for the realization of these advanced operations.\nOptimal operation of a Local energy system (LES) can be considered from different perspectives (Facility Operator, Microgrid Operator, Aggregator, DER Owner) and therefore achieved by prioritising and/or optimising indices like: energy efficiency, cost of operation, cost of ownership, energy cost, carbon footprint.\nComplete description\nTraditionally, Energy Management System (EMS) solutions provide a comprehensive way of understanding energy profiles, identifying actual energy use and waste, as well as perform control actions on a variety of production and storage assets of multiple vectors (thermal, electrical, gas).\nHowever, in the case of a Local Energy System (LES) where multiple business actors with different roles exist (e.g. DER Owner/Producer, Consumer), an enhanced solution is required to provide a top-level view of the operation of the system, enabling the realisation of optimisation scenarios. On this basis, the integration of the EMS with the controllers of the various storage and production assets is necessary. On the other hand, the integration with Building Management Systems (BMS) allows a more in-depth knowledge of the facilities’ loads (electrical or thermal), taking priority based decisions and enabling fine grained Demand Response (DR) actions.\nOn top of that, the EMS can make use of advanced tools related to forecasting and optimal operational scheduling/ future planning, which combined with all the above can help achieve optimal utilization of the constrained grid capacities, maximizing the use of on-site RES, by utilizing multi-vector energy blending, storage and DR actions.\nSuch an integrated system can enable the operation of the LES with the following advanced features: • Coordinated DER operation • Control over the energy mix and optimal use of storage with energy forecasting • Increased system reliability and power quality • Optimal load prioritization and shifting • Microgrid enabled operations: the ability of all integrated systems to work together as a single system, enabling facilities to operate as autonomous microgrids; • Quantification and measurement of overall carbon foot-print • Detailed monitoring of real-time energy-related data • Alerts for optimizing operational expenditures (OpEx)\nThe enhanced EMS will encompass the integration of the following sub-systems: • EMS: integrating the traditional DER Owner energy monitoring and control solution; • DER Controllers: On-site devices offering monitoring \u0026 control of the production assets of DER Owners; • Storage Controllers (Thermal/Electric/H2) Devices for multi-vector storage management, handling information on capacity and availability of storage assets of DER Owners; • BMS: Offering a monitoring network at a building level (evaluate energy usage/needs, occupancy, production, weather, etc.) as well as assisting real-time, data-driven decisions for the optimization of the consumption, by analysing offering various modes of operation (demand response, store energy) for various vectors; • Field Devices: For sensing or actuation of various loads, integrated through the BMS or directly; • EV/FCEV Chargers: Devices enabling the monitoring and control of the charging of Electric Vehicles and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles in the LES, typically owned by the local stakeholders or even third parties • External Data Sources: for weather forecasting and energy prices • Advanced tools: for energy forecasting (Energy Forecaster) and for optimal scheduling (Optimal Scheduler) and planning • Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): A system enabling the integration of the above sub-systems\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe goal of this HLUC is to describe how optimal multi-vector operation of a LES can be achieved, by coordinating the different available assets; providing a solution to the optimal control problem of DER, flexible loads and different storage technologies. On the basis of these flexibility assets and considering the different energy networks (i.e. electricity, heat, gas, Hydrogen) the operator of the LES, aims to achieve specific goals related to the economic operation, reduce environmental impact and reduce the dependency from the main grid. The role of the LES operator can be undertaken by various actors such as: the Distribution System Operator (DSO), the Aggregator (e.g. Virtual Power Plant, EV Charging Infrastructure Owner/Operators), the Microgrid Operator, the Facility Operator; whilst the role of the flexibility provider can be handled by DER Owners i.e. the owners of generation and storage assets of various energy vectors – as well as Consumers and in general an aggregated scheme of the previous e.g. a Community within the LES.\nComplete description\nThe task of leveraging the multi-vector assets of a Local Energy System (LES) for achieving an optimized operation can be viewed by different perspectives. From the perspective of the operator of the grid, pursuing efficiency, reduce environmental impact and reliability; a task undertaken by an actor such as the Grid/Microgrid/Facility Operator. On the other hand, the optimal management of such resources can be leveraged by an Aggregator aiming to maximize its profits through market participation (VPP concept).\nThe assets involved in a multi-vector LES case concern various type of DERs (e.g. wind, PV, solar thermal), flexible loads (e.g. EVs, FCEVs, HVAC) and different storage technologies (i.e. electrical, thermal, H2). The (multi-vector) flexibility assets are assumed to be provided by the various DER owners and consumers, owned by individuals or the community within the LES. The flexibility providers procure services to the operator of the LES, in order to support the grid operation, improve the overall system efficiency and/or reduce the carbon emissions and are assumed to receive reimbursements respectively. The core functionalities of the optimal operation concern: • Demand side management and the shifting/scheduling of multi-vector loads (see PUC 2 Shift Building Loads using Demand Side Management, PUC 3 Shift Harbour Loads using Demand Side Management) • Optimal scheduling of different storage vectors: electric, thermal and hydrogen-based (see PUC 4 Optimal Scheduling of Thermal and Electrical Storage, PUC 5 Optimal Scheduling of Electrical Storage and Hydrogen Storage, PUC 6 Storing Excess Generation in Thermal Network ) • Optimal Management of EV/FCEV related operations: (see PUC 7 Optimal Management of EV with Hydrogen and/or Electricity) The above functionalities are facilitated by forecasting, scheduling and integration services provided by the relevant tools developed in the project.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope This HLUC targets at describing the concept of sizing of the production and storage assets of a LES in order to: - Lower cost of energy use, Maximize profits from selling energy to the grid, - Reduce C02 emissions, and - Increase self-supply.   Objective(s) Calculating the optimal sizing of different components of the LES, consisting of:     Electrical and thermal energy production Electrical and thermal energy storage Based on electrical and thermal loads consumption data, as well as energy interchange with the electricity and district heating grid. | | Related business case(s) | PUC8 Multi-vector Optimisation of assets’ sizing in a LES PUC9 Optimal sizing of electrical parts of a LES |  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe optimal sizing of a multi-vector LES involves the sizing of different assets, in order to make its operation more efficient. The assets may concern: • Electrical production assets, like PV panels and Wind generators • Thermal production assets such as solar thermal panel and geothermal heat pumps • Storage assets, such as batteries and hot water tanks Depending on the role of the involved business actor (grid/microgrid operator, facility operator, aggregator, DER owner), the business goals and relevant optimization objectives can vary. The optimization is proposed to tackle the following objectives:\n Cost reduction for energy use or profit maximization from market participation Fossil fuels/CO2 emissions reduction Grid dependency reduction The optimization process should enable the operator to model and possibly combine the different objectives of the involved actors. In order to perform the simulations, the availability and cost of thermal and electrical energy exchanged with the main grids is considered. High import cost and low export price will increase the need for reducing the dependency of the LES from the main grid.  Complete description\nA multi-vector local energy system (LES) operator can pursuit various goals, depending on its roles. Such goals may concern: • Increasing quality of service for load and production assets (any vector) • Increasing energy efficiency and reliability of the LES • Minimizing cost of operation • Reducing the environmental impact (CO2 emissions) • Maximizing the profits from selling energy to the market\nTo achieve such goals, the LES operator, can consider investments in local energy production (i.e. Distributed energy resources - DERs) such as PV panels, Wind generators, solar thermal panels and geothermal heat pumps. The former two technologies can increase the self-production of electricity and reduce electricity costs. Moreover, they can reduce peak power consumption or even provide revenues from selling energy to the energy market. From the two latter technologies, the local heat production can contribute in reducing the dependency from District Heat (DH) supplier or even become a heat producer and supply the grid with excessive production. Such assets can be installed in the operator facilities or in the facilities of consumers, which may be involved in the investment by leasing their properties or even investing in the assets. This way the role of DER Owners is considered to be in close collaboration with the operator that orchestrates the investment.\nFurthermore, investments in storage of electrical and thermal energy can be considered and designed in order to lower the costs of energy supply from the main grid (e.g. peak shaving), as well as improve the profitability of energy production (by optimizing the energy consumption or energy trading). In a similar manner, local consumers/producers may be involved in such investments.\nThe core functionalities of the optimal planning comprise the modelling of the various assets and objectives of the investor, as well as the various ownership schemes in order to identify the most efficient scenarios for future investments.\nFrom the perspective of an investor (e.g. a DER owner), the needs of electrical and thermal energy should be evaluated, integrating the current and estimating the future loads (from different vectors) as way to increase self-consumption. Also, the energy market for electrical (i.e. the local DSO and customers in the LES) and thermal energy (i.e. the DH supplier and the customers in the LES) should be investigated in terms of volume versus value, both for import and export. Assessing these inputs and providing the relevant optimisation criteria and assets of interest, the investor must be provided with the most beneficial scenarios with regard to the sizing of assets and the investment cost. The optimisation should concern different vectors and possible transformations of energy amongst them.\nA typical use case should model the optimal sizing of electrical assets for storage and production, considering the current assets and the future electrical loads of the LES, whilst also considering production and loads (through transformation e.g. HVAC for heating) from other vectors(see - PUC 11: Sizing of electrical parts of a LES). In this scenario, the pricing of each energy vector (e.g. electric, thermal, gas) during the day and throughout the year will be considered, along with the constraints regarding the autonomous operation of the LES, as well as other techno-economic constraints.\nFinally, another use case combining both electrical and heating production and storage assets, should enable the identification of the optimal investment in the LES (see PUC 07: Multi-vector Optimisation of assets’ sizing in a LES).\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis high-level use case describes different scenarios incl. all required steps for the implementation of a tender based frequency control system. The UC differentiates between FCR (frequency containment reserve) and FRR (frequency restoration reserve) services. The explained approach is technology agnostic and supports any kind of flexibility resource, that can meet the technical requirements for balancing service provision. A common approach to handle different technologies for flexibility provision (industrial demand response, residential demand response aggregated by a VPP, smart charging of electric vehicles, aggregation of renewables (PV) via a VPP, battery energy storage, power-to-hydrogen electrolyser) is explained.\nThe scope of the use case includes dimensioning of balancing service reserves for an islanding system, prequalification of suitable distributed energy assets and intermediary platforms (Virtual Power Plants, VPPs), tendering and contracting balancing services, balancing service activation, monitoring, validation, and remuneration.\nAll periodic communication between the system operator and the market participants, like bidding, monitoring and activation is organized via a Flexibility Management and Trading Platform (FMTP).\nThe use case focuses on the situation on the Island of Mayotte and aims to adapt to the historically grown infrastructure and processes, but also takes into account updates of the system operators SCADA in the near future.\nComplete description\nIntroduction to balancing services for frequency control\nThe system operator Electricité de Mayotte (EDM), responsible for grid operation and supply of electric energy, needs to maintain the network frequency within a narrow bandwidth (+300 / -200 mHz) around 50 Hz. Frequency deviation is a consequence of an imbalance between generation (feed-in to the grid) and consumption (extraction from the grid) including losses of the grid itself. These imbalances are mainly caused by unpredictable fluctuations of the load (low impact on the grid frequency), general imprecisions in the load forecasting that cause improper generation schedules (medium impact) or rare fault-induced disconnection of entire branches or substations or even unexpected loss of generation (high impact). Until now, the electricity system in Mayotte relied on fast adaption of the generation of spinning diesel engines to balance the load fluctuations. These diesel engines also cover for the main generation schedule.\nThe mechanisms to maintain the grid frequency within a narrow bandwidth can be distinguished between three main types of control, as shown in Figure 24. After an incident like the unexpected outage of a generator, the imbalance between load and generation causes an immediate decrease of the grid frequency, which is mainly limited by the kinetic energy stored in spinning machines (synchronous inertia). The higher the inertia of the rotating machines connected to the grid, the lower the gradient of frequency change (Df/Dt), also known as rate of change in frequency (ROCOF). The frequency stabilization by inertia is a physical effect, responding spontaneously to any frequency gradient and acting in both directions. New generations of inverters can provide a frequency gradient dependent feed-in (with only a minor time lag), which can be considered as “virtual inertia”.\n[See figure “Overview of phases of frequency control after a major outage” below]\nThe frequency containment reserve (FCR), also known as primary control, provides a variable feed-in linearly depending on the deviation of the frequency (Df) from the target value of 50 Hz. FCR is required to act very fast. The required full activation time (FAT) is determined by the considered maximum imbalance (e.g., due to loss of the largest generation unit in the system), the maximum allowed frequency deviation and the typical inertia of the system. FCR is a very fast service that requires frequency measurements and control logic directly at the providing asset, usually a generator or battery. Some loads controlled by power electronics might also be feasible to provide FCR. Usually, FCR is a symmetric service that acts in both directions. The linear function of FCR power only depending on the frequency deviation enables a fast response to limit the frequency deviation but does not allow to bring the frequency back to the target value. Some transmission system operators (TSO), e.g., in the NORDPOOL, differentiate between Frequency Containment Reserve for Normal Operation (FCR-N) and Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D). FCR-N is a symmetric service providing upregulation and downregulation with a linear characteristic while FCR-D differentiate between upward (increase feed-in or decrease consumption) and downward (decrease feed-in or increase consumption) regulation. FCR-D is only activated after exceeding a threshold value of frequency deviation.\n[See figure “FCR architecture overview” below]\nThe frequency restoration reserve FRR is managed by the system operator (SO) using the automatic generation control (AGC). The AGC calculates setpoints for multiple balancing providing assets (generators, batteries but also fast and precisely controllable loads like electrolyser). After reception of the setpoint the assets will adapt the power output within a defined FAT that may be longer than required for FCR. The AGC aims to bring the system frequency back to the target value. FRR requires reliable communication between the central AGC and the distributed assets. FRR can be divided into positive products for upward control and negative products for downward control. European TSO differentiate between faster, automatically controlled reserves (aFRR), that follow to instantaneous setpoints, and slower reserves that might be manually controlled (mFRR) and follow to received schedules.\n[See figure “FRR architecture overview” below]\nFCR and FRR provision in Europe usually require active power measurements with high precision (e.g., 0.5% error class) and submission of data points to the SO in short intervals (e.g., 1-2 s) for the purpose of real-time monitoring of provision and ex-post validation of the provided services.\nAdditional Emergency measures will be activated in case that the frequency regulation system failed, and the frequency deviation exceeds defined thresholds. Emergency measure can include load shedding, disconnection of large, robust consumers or disconnection of generators. The rules for frequency protection devices to disconnect sensible assets in case of high frequency deviations must be defined accordingly to support system frequency stabilization and to avoid negative feedback on the frequency control mechanisms.\nContext\nThe rising number of PV power plants to be installed and connected to the main grid in Mayotte may increase the difficulty of frequency control as the production is highly dependent on weather conditions challenging to forecast (e.g., a passing cloud leads to a decline in PV production) which may increase the imbalances between generation and consumption. With increasing number of PV generation, partly replacing diesel generators the ratio of spinning machines in the system will be reduced which has negative impact on the synchronous inertia. To avoid reaching low frequency thresholds leading to load shedding (48.5 Hz, 48 Hz and 47.5 Hz), the French Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) granted an exemption to EDM to operate the grid at a higher frequency. The current mean frequency value is thus of 50.15 Hz, higher than the 50 Hz stipulated in the EU Electricity Network code.\nThe main balancing service to cope with the frequency deviation currently applied on the island of Mayotte is the “primary reserve” (covering FCR and FRR), which is estimated at 15% of the daily demand and mainly supported by the EDM diesel generation sets of Longoni and Badamiers. The generators are limited to operate at 80-85% of their maximal capacity. For the past few years, the primary reserve hadn’t exceeded 8 MW, but this will change soon with an expected rising demand and RES integration.\nTo stabilize the frequency in the island and ease the penetration of renewable energy, the French Energy Regulatory Commission CRE launched a call for tender to install a battery for frequency control in July 2018. This 4 MW/2 MWh battery should be installed and be ready to operate in October 2021. Following this installation, the exemption (of higher system frequency) should disappear for the time-being. It is estimated that further investments will be needed to fulfil the requirements that are foreseen in the future.\nOne of the goals when considering the frequency use case is to find a way for moving from the energy assets providing frequency services with the help of fossil fuel to assets using renewable energy sources (RES) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). To further reduce the primary reserve provided by the EDM’s diesel generation sets new sources for providing frequency regulation services are needed to have a direct impact on reduction of CO2 emissions.\nThe main challenges when implementing the frequency control framework are related to the identification of sufficient assets from RES to reduce the required capacity of fossil fueled generators that are capable to provide similar reliable frequency services.\nThe use case describes the interactions between the main actors and platforms but doesn’t discuss the details of the balancing products. The details of the designed balancing products will be defined Deliverable D4.1 Report detailing the energy market framework and specific product design details.\nFor the MAESHA project, it has been decided to examine how different flexibility sources could support the frequency control on the island:\n•Industrial Demand Response\nIndustry’s main purpose is manufacturing of goods or provision of other services. Some industrial assets are additionally able to provide a certain help to the system operator by adjusting their internal manufacturing process and thus increase or decrease the consumption for the time being (load shifting) and help minimizing the frequency deviation. Such industrial energy assets usually have some restrictions, such as limited duration of delivery (e.g., max 4 h), poor controllability (e.g., ON-OFF operation), or can provide such action only at a certain time of the day or year. Therefore, industrial demand response is not considered as a primary source for providing balancing services to the power grid, but they may serve as secondary source for additional support when other services are already fully activated (e.g., for emergency measures).\n• Residential Demand Response managed by a virtual power plant (VPP)\nResidential customers may have flexible loads that end-users do not necessarily need instantaneously to ensure their comfort, e.g., air-conditioning units and electric heating, but also dishwashers, washing machines, cloth dryers, etc. Optimally controlling the on/off times of these devices, considering local frequency deviations, can help in ensuring the frequency stability. Depending on the characteristics of the device, the activation time and activation duration differ. Heat pumps or air conditioning units can be used for frequency response, considering the heat storage capacity of the building or heat storage in a hot water tank. The activation duration depends upon the stored heat capacity in the building or the tank and the comfort requirements of the end-users. These units can be activated very fast (remote switch-off) but their availability is difficult to forecast.\n• Smart Charging of electric vehicles (EV) and vehicle to grid (V2G)\nSmart charging of EV can be a source of consumption flexibility and theoretically be used even for balancing services. The challenges for provision of FRR by an EV are linked to the prediction of the charging process’ time and duration as well as the limited hours per day, when EV charging can be used for load shifting. Nevertheless, the forecasting of consumption and flexibility becomes easier on a fleet of EVs, as such an aggregate of a higher number of EV’s can provide ancillary services reliably using a minor share of the predicted consumption. Load reduction in EV charging can be achieved by reducing the charging power (e.g., switch from 3-phase to 1-phase charging) of a certain number of vehicles. Advanced fleet management might also allow downward services by increasing the charging power during the requested period. Feed-in of energy stored in the EV’s batteries (V2G) will been investigated as another possibility of upward regulation by EVs but comes with practical drawbacks like possible reduction of battery lifetime and the need for bidirectional inverters. Due to the nature of the fleet management and lower frequency of data acquisition, EV charging will be preferably applied for mFRR than for aFRR or FCR like frequency services.\n• Virtual Power Plant (VPP) aggregating RES\nThe variability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are causing continuous, small frequency deviations due to their hard to predict short-term dynamics and their lack of synchronous inertia to stabilize the frequency during disturbances. Lowering the output of PV plants (downward regulation) during high frequency periods can support frequency stabilization. If PVs are operated below their maximal inverter power, PV plants can inject additional power into the grid with different activation times, ranging from seconds to minutes during low frequency periods (upward regulation). The latter will result in a reduction of overall generation or require the installation of PV batteries. The activation duration depends on the amount of reserve kept for upward frequency response and will be the result of a cost-benefit analysis, where the outcome depends on the remuneration of the different frequency response products compared to the value of electric energy fed-in by PV. In the last years, much development effort has been made on virtual inertia provided by PV and wind power, which might become state-of-the-art within the next decades.\n• Battery Energy Storage System\nBy supplying or absorbing power in response to deviations from the nominal frequency and imbalances between supply and demand, the rapid response of a BESS will provide a frequency stabilizing services. The fast response capability of BESS allows them to participate in all kinds of frequency response (e.g., FCR, FRR) or even a fast or enhanced frequency response markets (activation in less than 5 s). The BESS will also provide virtual inertia by modulating active power as a function of the ROCOF. The duration of the service provision will be determined by the SoC. BESS providing ancillary services will require an additional charge management to maintain the state of charge (SOC) within predefined limits (e.g., 30%\u003cSOC\u003c70%) in order to ensure the continuous availability of upward and downward regulation ability. Load management (consumption or feed-in) is based on schedules and should be communicated with the SO, e.g., via an intraday program. The BESS should be able to provide multiple balancing services and perform load management in parallel.\n• Power-to-Hydrogen system\nProton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysers have the capability of modifying their load rapidly with very high ramps rates (i.e., within seconds) and within a wide operational range up to the nominal power. This flexibility can be utilized for large range of frequency regulation (e.g., FCR, aFRR, mFRR). Despite the hydrogen storage capacity, there is no limit in the duration of the service as the service is provided by reducing/increasing the load of the electrolyser.\nThese DER provide their flexibility to the SO via the FMTP, as indicated in Figure below.\n[See figure “Architecture overview for frequency control in MAESHA” below]\nFunctions\nThis Use Case relies on the following functions: •Asset contraction and technical preparation, incl. pre-qualification •Detection of frequency deviations •Evaluation of flexibility available from different assets or via intermediate platforms •Contracting balancing service products •Calculation of setpoints by the AGC of the SO •Flexibility activation through the Flexibility Management and Trading Platform (FMTP) •Monitoring of service provision •Settlement process to remunerate flexibility activation\nThis Use Case supports a technology-agnostic approach for provision of balancing services by central or decentralized energy assets. In the MAESHA project, the following technologies are aimed to be investigated in the scope of the use case demonstration: •Detection of frequency deviations, central by SO or decentral by the DER •Frequency regulation by industrial DR •Frequency regulation by residential DR via VPP •Frequency regulation by Smart charging/V2G •Frequency regulation by RES via VPP •Frequency regulation by BESS •Frequency regulation by P2H system\n1.5.

Step by Step Analysis of Use Case 4.1. Overview of Scenarios    No. Scenario Name Scenario Description Primary Actor Triggering Event Pre-Condition Post-Condition     1 Customer process This scenario deals with onboarding customer for providing flexibility. It starts from definition of some products, contract format, and information consents for customers, who want to provide flexibility. Also aggregating the customer flexibility, registration in FR, and providing the information of resources for prequalification is part of this scenario.  Customer process     2 Prequalification process This scenario focuses on prequalification of 1) Flexibility Service Providers, 2) product prequalification (the technical specification of product), and 3) the grid assessment of the flexibility product (‘grid prequalification’), for example if the flexibilities can cause congestions in the grid (‘grid prequalification’).  Prequalification process     3 Trading process This scenario deals with trading of flexibility products, which are previously defined with Market operators (System Operators might have a role of MO) and possibly standardized. Flexibility Service Providers offer flexibilities for these defined flexibility products in parallel markets while System Operators looking for the optimum solutions. In this mechanism, OO takes into account the maximum global benefit and bid qualification (network limits). This means that it may happen that more than one System Operator will be willing to buy same flexibility.Therefore, it is not necessarily the cheapest flexibility which would bring highest socio-economic value. bids. The MO are responsible to clear the bids, therefore, timing and clearing of markets need to be coordinated between the markets, when there are markets running in parallel.  Trading process     4 Secondary trading For longer term flexibility products, FSPs may wish to trade their flexibility contracts to another qualified participant if they cannot fullfill the obligations. The scenario is similar but simpler that the original trading, scenario 3. The SO needs to be notified of this trade to continue with scenarios 4-6  Secondary trading     5 Activation This Scenario describes the process of activation of the flexibility, taking into account any grid limitations, and the needed data exchange. Notifying the activation requests to the Flexibility Service Providers (FSPs) must happen in a reliable and timely manner according to the relevant terms and conditions applicable to FSPs.  Activation     6 Delivery and monitoring (real-time) This scenario focuses on monitoring the flexibility delivery. Actual flexibility delivered is calculated as the difference between baseline and metered consumption/generation of that resource. In this regard, FSP need to provide the real-time metering data and FRO calculates the amount of flexibility delivered and the possible difference between it and the requested amount. If needed OO can start a new procurement. requested flexibility.  Delivery and monitoring (real-time)     7 Verification and settlement This scenario focuses on verification and balance and financial settlement The verification takes place by comparing the actually delivered flexibility and flexibility traded on the markets. FSP is asked for a penalty if actually delivered flexibility is less than requested flexibility. Measured data is sent to Datahub and trades in the markets to ISR for the balance settlement. Market operator financially settles the trades for the market participants.  Verification and settlement      Notes\n4.2.

Objective(s) Provide input data to DSO in order to assess voltage levels and power flows at distribution network   Related business case(s) PUC12    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nPlaced within the abovementioned BUCs, PUC1 describes how the forecast provider extracts, transforms and loads (ETL) the data needed by the DSO to assess voltage levels and power flows. It is composed by four Secondary Use Cases (scenarios):\n Get measurement form substation Get meteo forecast Generation of load forecast KPI calculation for load forecast  Complete description\nThis PUC makes reference to the forecasting modules focused on the operation of the DSO and the distribution network. In order to increase the performance of these modules, data requests to external systems will be sent. Finally, the results of the algorithms will be available to external actors/applications.\nType of considered forecasts: •\tLoad Forecast: Forecast of total demand at a substation (primary or secondary).\nThe time-granularity/horizon of the forecast can be: •\tVery short-term: 1h (5 or 15 min steps), •\tShort-term: 24-48 h (15min-1hour step), •\tMedium-term: 48h-10days (1-hour step)\nThe PUC will deepen in the following steps that are necessary to forecast the total demand at a substation:\n Forecast Provider retrieves current load from substation. Forecast Provider asks for meteo forecast to Weather Forecast. Forecast Provider corrects wrong/missing data, using an algorithm for anomalies detection. Forecast Provider generates a mathematical model for load, using the historical data, and it applies the current load to the mathematical model, getting the load forecast. Forecast Provider sends the forecasts to DSO. DSO sends the forecasts to Coordinet platform (actors who need it for their activities).  Besides, KPIs related to accuracy of prediction will be calculated in order to get the efficacy of the forecast done.\nWithin the related business use cases, this primary use case, jointly with PUC2 (RES forecast in DN), focuses on the BUCs’ first step from DSO side:\nMore precisely, PUC1 is divided into four secondary use cases also referred to as scenarios:\n•\tSUC 1.1 – Get measurement from substation: The Forecast Provider asks for current load to the Substation, which returns that measure.\n•\tSUC 1.2 – Get meteo forecast: The Forecast Provider asks for the weather prediction to the Weather Forecast Provider, an external server which does not belong to Coordinet ecosystem. The request contains the moment of time to be considered, such as prediction for 1 hour by or 24 hours by. The response contains the weather forecasting for that moment.\n•\tSUC1.3 – Generation of load forecast: After correcting wrong/missing data, the Forecast Provider generates a model of load for a period of time, using weather forecast and historical data related to load. Once this model is prepared, the Forecast Provider uses the current measurement to generate its prediction.\n•\tSUC1.4 – KPI calculation for load forecast: The KPIs are calculated in order to determine if the prediction is good enough. This calculation is done considering the load prediction and the real load.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Enhance of active power flexibility (i.e., ramping, droop control and power regulation) through the use of distributed flexible resources (energy storage and PV systems)   Objective(s) • Maintain frequency stability   • Demonstrate congestion management for maintaining capacity limits of the grid    Related business case(s) None    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nCyprus power system favors the massive installation of PV due to the climate conditions (abundant of sun) in order to achieve the national environmental target. The high penetration of renewables in combination with the islanded nature of the system creates critical challenges related to frequency stability and balancing (due to the unpredicted nature of RES). In addition, several distribution feeders in the island experience large concentration of PVs and as a result, local congestion problems (voltage and thermal limit violations) appear.\nActive power flexibilities provided within this use case will enhance the frequency stability, relieve the congestion of the system, and achieve a cost-effective operation of the system. This business use case exploits the flexible resources of the distribution grid (large energy storage systems, PV parks, prosumers) to provide active power related services in the framework of primary, secondary reserve such as:\n• Droop control of flexible resources to support frequency,\n• Ramping control to compensate large power fluctuations.\nFurthermore, the business use case will enable the participation of the distributed resources in the intra-day market by providing active flexibility services, such as:\n• Peak shaving service to relieve local congestion problems,\n• Power regulation to track day-ahead profile.\nAll these services will be procured by both the transmission and distribution system operators (TSO and DSO) to the TSO market and the DSO local market. The communication between the TSO and the DSO control center with the TSO market and the DSO local market respectively will be facilitated through the OneNet system. The energy market will allocate the services to the different flexible actors (aggregators and prosumers) according to the market rules. The activation of these services will be coordinated by the operators and/or based on the grid operating conditions.\nThe provision of droop and ramping control are currently provided by the conventional generation plants at the transmission level of the system, while this business use case will enable the distributed resources to provide and remunerated for these services. In addition, peak shaving services can provide local congestion management capabilities to minimize PV curtailments and increase the penetration of photovoltaic energy.\nComplete description\nThe TSO and DSO monitor the system in real time to ensure the proper operation of the system within the desired limits. The monitoring of the transmission system is facilitated by PMUs and SCADA measurements while the monitoring of the distribution grid is enabled by smart meter and SCADA. In this BUC the Active Balancing congestion management (ABCM) platform at the TSO and DSO control center (ABCM-T and ABCM-D) play a critical role, while the OneNet system facilitates the information exchange between the different actors. In this BUC two distinct services are included namely the frequency balancing and the congestion management. A high-level description for the frequency balancing is provided below:\nThe TSO procures frequency balancing products to the TSO and DSO local market.\nTSO and DSO send the location-based prequalified operational limits (as they were calculated through the ABCM-T and ABCM-D platforms) to the two markets respectively in order to ensure the safe operation of the transmission and distribution grid.\nFSPs at the transmission and distribution level send their bids in the TSO market and the local DSO market\nThe local DSO market is cleared and the awarded availability bids are forwarded to the TSO market\nThe TSO market is cleared and the awarded activation bids are sent to the FSPs at the transmission and distribution level.\nIn the occurrence of a frequency event the awarded FSPs are activated automatically and (at the transmission and distribution level) provide frequency balancing.\nThe TSO and DSO through the ABCM-T and ABCM-D platforms evaluate the response of their FSPs to the frequency event and send an evaluation report to the market.\nIn the case of the congestion management the services are limited only to the distribution grid therefore only the FSPs at the distribution grid provides congestion management services in order to overcome overloading condition to the distribution grid. A high-level description for the congestion management is provided below:\nThe DSO procures congestion management products to the DSO local market.\nDSO sends the location-based prequalified operational limits (as they were calculated through the ABCM-D platform) to the DSO local market in order to ensure the safe operation of the distribution grid.\nFSPs at the distribution level send their activation bids in the local DSO market.\nThe local DSO market is cleared and the awarded activation bids are sent to the qualified FSPs at the distribution level.\nIn the occurrence of a feeder overloading the awarded FSPs are activated through coordination signals sent by the ABCM-D platform in order to overcome grid congestion.\nThe DSO through the ABCM-D platform evaluate the response of their FSPs to the congestion management event and send an evaluation report to the DSO local market.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Enhance of reactive power flexibility and power quality (i.e., voltage support, congestion management, phase balancing) through the use of distributed flexible resources (energy storage and PV systems)   Objective(s) • Maintain voltage stability   • Demonstrate congestion management for maintaining capacity limits of the grid    • Achieve power quality enhancement    Related business case(s) None    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nCyprus power system favors the massive installation of PV due to the climate conditions (abundant of sun) in order to achieve the national environmental target. The high penetration of renewables in specific feeders causes local congestion problems (voltage and thermal limit violations) in the distribution grid. In addition, the majority of loads are single phase connected to the grid, creating intense phase imbalances and thus the power quality and the grid capacity are negatively affected. Reactive power flexibilities provided within this use case will enhance the voltage stability, relieve the congestion of the system and increase the system efficiency, while phase balancing services will improve the power quality and increase the system capacity by symmetrizing the phase loading. Therefore, this business use case exploits the flexible resources of the distribution grid (large energy storage systems, PV parks, prosumers) to provide reactive power and phase balancing services. These services will be procured by the distribution system operator (DSO) to the DSO local market. The information exchange between the DSO control center and the local DSO market will be facilitated by the OneNet system. The energy market will allocate the services to the different flexible actors (aggregators and prosumers) according to the market rules. The activation of these services will be coordinated by the operators and/or based on the grid operating conditions.\nCurrently, the reactive/voltage support is performed by reactors/capacitors installed in the transmission level or by predefined support schemes (i.e., cosφ(P)) provided by the PV inverters in the distribution grid. In addition, phase balancing has recently introduced in the IEEE standards for microgrids but has not been used in distribution grids. In this business use, reactive support and phase balancing will be provided by flexible resources and will be online coordinated by DSO to increase efficiency, relieve congestion, reduce curtailments and increase PV penetration. The flexible resources will be remunerated for these services enhancing their competitiveness in the energy market.\nComplete description\nThe DSO monitors the system in real time to ensure the proper operation of the system within the desired limits. The monitoring of the distribution grid is enabled by smart meter and SCADA. In this BUC the Active Balancing congestion management platform at the DSO control center (ABCM-D) play a critical role, while the OneNet system facilitates the information exchange between the different actors in the distribution grid. A high-level description for the congestion management is provided below: • The DSO procures congestion management products (phase balancing and reactive support) to the DSO local market. • The DSO sends the location-based prequalified operational limits (as they were calculated through the ABCM-D platform) to the DSO local market in order to ensure the safe operation of the distribution grid. • FSPs at the distribution level send their activation bids in the local DSO market • The local DSO market is cleared and the awarded activation bids are sent to the qualified FSPs at the distribution level. • In the occurrence of a power quality issue or voltage limit violation the awarded FSPs are activated through coordination signals sent by the ABCM-D platform in order to overcome grid congestion. • The DSO through the ABCM-D platform evaluate the response of their FSPs to the congestion management event and send an evaluation report to the DSO local market.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope The scope of this UC is to establish an optimization framework for maximizing the use of self-generated energy, having a building asset as its focus. Relevant components from the ACCEPT architecture are: Building Digital Twin, On-Demand Flexibility Management   Objective(s) 1. Reduce residential energy bills through increase self-consumption of renewable energy   2. Share of total consumption is covered by local green energy.    Related business case(s) UC02 is generalized by UC13 (building to community level self-consumption)   UC02 includes UC01 (requires the monitoring and metering functionality prescribed in that UC)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis Use Case (UC) deals with the optimal scheduling of operation for HVAC resources at building/apartment level, combined with the heat energy storage capabilities offered by the building envelope or hot water storage tanks, so as to increase the consumption of self-generated electricity via renewable resources. Consequently, the UC’s objective is also to minimize the dependence of a single consumer from the grid, by making him/her self-sufficient.\nComplete description\nThe concept of Virtual Energy Storage (VES) is tightly connected to the demand-side management on intra-building thermal loads. The building envelope and available hot water storage tanks are examined as thermal storage devices, whilst the building also serves as the energy sink. Local Power-to-Heat units operate as energy sources, and the heat generated can be either utilized directly to satisfy the occupants’ comfort needs or stored to be utilized in a later moment in time. The significance of such functionality increases considerably when the building is equipped with Renewable Energy Resources (RES), such as Photovoltaic (PV) panels. This free resource of energy, due to its intermittent nature, does not commonly match the end-user demand and thus cannot always be readily consumed. One solution to this is energy trading to/from the grid, this though poses issues of energy balancing and management to the grid operator. Self-consumption is another way to minimize the loss of freely produced renewable energy. In this setting, the combined effect of being able to store thermal energy and modify to some extent the thermal demand leads to the best intra-building utilization of self-production. VES is an inherent part of the building Digital Twin model and is also tightly dependent on input from the Citizen Twin module. It combines the thermal properties of the building envelope and hot water storage with the usage patterns of its occupants and their comfort perception, so as to perform a short or mid-term optimization on use of resources that maximize the use of any renewable energy generated in the premises.\n1.5.

This UC is envisioned to deal with assets directly managed by the operator of the grid, while assets from other actors will be indirectly operated through De-mand Side Management (DSM) in UC 2.10 and UC 2.11. Any microgrid operator will have two simultaneous objectives when managing this kind of assets: • Keep quality of the supply • Minimize energy flows in and out of the microgrid (i.e. minimizing dependency on the external network and RES surplus, thus maximizing self-sufficiency) This use case describes how those assets can be operated in an optimal way, following these assumptions: • First schedule is optimized energy-wise (maximize self-sufficiency) • Technical constraints (I or V congestions) coming from that schedule are assessed, which may deviate the original schedule from its optimal\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope The scope of this UC is to establish the pipeline from monitoring and metering of building assets, to occupant and device modelling, flexibility forecasting and finally application of control actions to the flexible resources. Relevant components of the ACCEPT system are: Building Digital Twin, Building Citizen Twin, On-Demand Flexibility Management (additionally: BIML, citizen apps, community portfolio management)   Objective(s) 1. Provide intra-day and day-ahead forecasts of flexibility (possibility for upwards of downwards regulation of a building/asset consumption), based on the energy resources installed in the premises.   2. Translate flexibility requests to the building into scheduling operations for the electricity resources in the building/apartment/thermal zones.    Related business case(s) UC03 includes UC01 (requires the monitoring and metering functionality prescribed in that UC)   UC03 is included in UCs 07, 08 and 13 (UC07 and UC08 and UC13 use functionality from UC03)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe Use Case (UC) captures one of the core functionalities to be provided by the on-demand Flexibility Management component of the ACCEPT solution. In order for consumers to participate into energy markets, it is necessary to be able to provide forecasts of their baseline demand, as well as any upwards or downwards regulations of this baseline that can be provided, at specific future time intervals. The process depends on the modelling of the characteristics of the building, combined with the installed heating/cooling, resources DHW and other small electrical resources, as well as the modelling of the occupants’ behaviour. Both of the above are translated into mathematical constraints that allow the execution of a number of numerical optimizations, that yield the quantitative forecasts in terms of baseline and flexibility offered by the asset.\nComplete description\nAggregators and energy communities are anticipated to contribute significantly to the coming years in the opening of energy markets to demand flexibility. The way to do so is through aggregation of flexibility from individual consumers or district wide assets. This UC concentrated mainly on the first part and aims to enable the participation of consumers at building level to such markets. One of the first and necessary steps towards implementing this business scenario, is the forecasting of demand flexibility potential for each asset. To achieve this, individual consumer data, such as occupancy, device operational statuses, environmental conditions, metering and price data, along with occupants’ comfort preferences need to be monitored. Upon establishing this information management layer, the algorithms implemented in the citizen twin module process the data to identify the comfort and activity preferences of the occupants. In parallel, the building digital twin module must model the electricity resources and thermal characteristics of the building. These models are then fed to the flexibility demand management component, which also takes as input forecasts of the environmental conditions and is able to estimate the future requirements and flexibility, in terms of energy, of each device/apartment/building. The computed flexibility forecasts can then be sent to the community flexibility management layer for realizing the participation in the energy market.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nProvide DR events at both LEC Level and end-user level, in order to provide appropriate services to the electricity market\nComplete description\nRegardless of their role, that is ESCO, Retailer or Aggregator, LECs can provide valuable services to both the electricity market and the local DSO, if so requested. Utilizing the appropriate assets available at the moment, their potential and forecast, the decision support system can provide the available option to the Local Energy community manager, and he/she can decide upon the appropriate course of action. This decision will trigger to send the appropriate DR signals to the assets available at that time. These assets can range from a local PV plant to an appliance connected to the grid. The availability of such assets, along with their rated power, current power, flexibility potential and forecast for that time period should be made aware to the LEC manager, in order to assign the appropriate DR signals to the appropriate assets. The availability of those assets is retrieved via notifying the end-users accordingly and having retrieved their informed consent. To that end an appropriate mathematical formulation of the optimization problem at hand will be shaped and the most suitable optimization techniques will be employed, ranging from mixed-integer linear programming to metaheuristics and robust optimization, depending on the circumstances.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis BUC describes the DSO long term procurement of flexibility services through a market mechanism to avoid congestions at the distribution medium or low voltage networks. It describes the exchange of information and processes that should be established between DSO, Independent Market Operator (IMO) and Flexibility Provider (FSP). This BUC is divided into five scenarios, namely the five service steps defined in the Active System Management (ASM) report [1] listed below: ·\tPrepare/Pre-qualification: The process in which it is checked whether a unit can deliver the product it intends to sell. ·\tPlan/Forecast: Planning of grid utilization and identifying potential congestions. ·\tMarket Phase: Market opening, qualification, bids collection, market clearing and communication of results. ·\tMonitoring and Activation: Grid monitoring and flexibility bids activation to solve the forecasted congestion management ·\tMeasurement phase: Validation of delivery\nComplete description\nThis BUC will demonstrate the long-term congestion management procurement of local flexibility products by the DSO.\nThis BUC describes the exchanges of information and the processes that should be established between DSO, IMO and FSP to solve distribution network local congestions.\nThe objective is to procure products to ensure the network remains secure and does not go beyond its firm capacity at times of peak demand. The products can be procured from weeks to years ahead delivery, and is aimed towards MV/LV flexibility providers.\nThe DSO procures the product in the long-term (years to weeks ahead delivery). The DSO procures a band of flexibility that will be activated when needed or as scheduled, one or more times during the life of the contract. The flexibility providers receive a payment for the availability during the life of the contract and if activation is needed, the flexibility provider may receive an additional utilisation payment or not (to be defined at the contract) . If the activation is not delivered, penalties may be applied to the flexibility provider. If the flexibility is delivered as contracted, the DSO proceeds with the settlement as agreed at the contract.\nScenarios:\n  Prepare/Pre-qualification: The pre-qualification process starts once the flexibility service provider expresses interest in entering the flexibility market. This process serves to ensure that a particular flexibility service provider is capable of delivering a given product. This has to be ensured from two perspectives, namely the grid pre-qualification and product pre-qualification. The former ensures that the resource meets the technical requirements to be able to deliver the product and proceed to the market phase and eventually be selected by a system operator. In principle, the grid pre-qualification will be done by the DSO, as FSPs in this BUC are connected to MV and LV grids. The grid pre-qualification may involve both internal simulations by the DSO and/or specific field tests with the FSP. The market or product pre-qualification aims at ensuring that the FSP can participate in a particular market and can provide a particular service considering market and product design aspects. In principle, the product pre-qualification should be done by IMO. If the results of the two types of pre-qualification are approved, the entry of the FSP into the flexibility market is allowed. The validity of the pre-qualification can be indefinite, limited to a certain period of time or conditioned to predefined aspects (e.g. grid conditions). Considering that this BUC WECL-ES-01 describes the long-term products for the Spanish demonstration, it is also possible that the pre-qualification process starts once a market session is open, considering that a market session can last for weeks or longer. Whenever possible, the pre-qualification processes (grid and product) will be combined or coordinate, aiming at having the simplest possible process for the FSP. Likewise, the pre-qualification processes of WECL-ES-01 and WECL-ES-02 will also aim at coordination and simplification whenever the requirement allow to.\n  Plan/Forecast:\n  In this service phase, the DSO carries internal analysis (e.g. forecasts, power flows) to detect congestions in the grid, which could be solved by the long-term procurement of flexibility. This service phase happens years to weeks ahead.\nMarket Phase:  Based on the flexibility needs identified in the previous market phase, the DSO is able to call a market through the market platform (described in SUC-ES-01). This market, operated by the independent market operator, will procure either availability only or availability and activation. The availability means a capacity band (e.g. in kW) with a start and finish times defined, in which the FSP is expected to provide the flexibility upon the DSO’s call. Alternatively, the availability can also mean that the FSP is obliged to bid in the short-term local congestion management markets (defined in WECL-ES-02) activation products, in which capacity and duration of activation are predefined (in kWh). It is also possible to the DSO to procure activation in the long-term, defining weeks/months in advance the day, time, capacity and duration of activations.\nThis market phase can be classified as a local market model. It is an auction type of market, in which the gate opening time takes place from than more than year-ahead to weeks ahead. The gate closure time takes place a week-ahead delivery. FSPs participating should have resources connected to medium or low voltage levels.\nDuring this phase there is a qualification process to check if the flexibility provider is able to provide the demand service in terms of quality and cost.\nThe results of the auction will be published.\nMonitoring and Activation:  This service phase takes place close to real-time and in real-time. The DSO will monitor the conditions of the grid in real time and send the activation signals to the FSPs committed in the market phase, in accordance to the type of product procured.\nWhen activating the FSPs, the DSO will consider the actual state of the grid. Emergency states in which the procured flexibility activations cannot be concluded are outside the scope of this BUC WECL-ES-01. Emergency states are situations in which market procedures are no longer appropriate to ensure the security of the system.\nMeasurement phase:  In this final service phase, the MO and/or DSO will verify if the flexibility was provided in accordance to the product procured in the market phase. This service phase can take place in the real-time and/or after the real-time. For the measurement of flexibility, a baseline has to be previously defined, to which the actual metered data of the FSP can be compared too. If the FSP is not able to deliver the flexibility in accordance to the predefined market conditions and agreed baseline, penalties may apply, which would decrease the remuneration received by FSP.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nFlexible resources connected to transmission and distribution system can provide flexibility to system operators to eliminate congestions through a market mechanism. This BUC in transmission and/or distribution system, in order to keep power flows within the accepted thermal limits of the lines. These information exchanges of information mechanisms should be adaptable to any future market model or governance issues. Some different time frame markets will be examined: •\tDay Ahead •\tIntraday For each time frame, we will approach some of the following process phases of ASM report:\n Prepare/Pre-qualification: The process in which it is checked whether a unit can deliver the product it intends to sell, taking into account the network conditions. Plan/Forecast: Planning of grid utilization and identifying potential congestions. Market Phase: Bids collection and selection, short-term contracts (capacity products) and short-term products/services (selection of energy products) Monitoring and Activation: Grid monitoring and flexibility bids activation to solve the forecasted congestion management Measurement and Settlement phase: Validation of delivery Some of the above process phases may be similar for both time frames. In this Business Use Case, the measurement and settlement phase will not be addressed. The developed information exchange mechanisms will be implemented in order to have a verification process.  Complete description\nFlexible resources connected to transmission and distribution system can provide flexibility to system operators to eliminate congestions through a market mechanism. This BUC describes the exchanges of information and the processes that should be established for different scenarios: pre-qualification, plan/forecast, market phase and monitoring and activation phase. For each scenario, we will always take into account different timeframes (intraday and day-ahead) and how they are related. Pre-qualification The pre-qualification process should start after a flexibility service provider expresses interest in entering the flexibility market. This process serves to ensure that a particular flexibility service provider is capable of delivering a given product. In order to do that, two types of pre-qualification should be considered: Product Pre-qualification and Grid Pre-qualification. The former ensures that the resource contains the technical requirements to be able to deliver the product and proceed to the market phase and eventually selected by a system operator. These technical requirements are defined by DSO and TSO and after the FSP indicates the attributes of the product it wants to deliver, a pre-qualification test should be performed to verify that all attributes are in compliance with the technical requirements. This test may be repeated on a periodic basis or whenever the characteristics of the product are found to change significantly. The product pre-qualification can be done either by the DSO or TSO, regardless of its location. In case a system operator wants to activate a product already pre-qualified by another system operator, the former should have access to this information in order to make the process more efficient and not to pre-qualify the same product twice. Regarding grid pre-qualification, this process ensures that the product provided by the Flexible Service Provider will not cause constraints in the networks where it is connected. This process can be avoided if the System Operators have already identified the areas where flexibility is always allowed. The grid pre-qualification should be performed by the System Operator of the network to which the product is connected in order to verify if the maximum capacity of the product does not impact the network it is connected to. If the results of the two types of pre-qualification are approved, the entry of the FSP into the flexibility market is allowed. The Pre-qualification scenario is independent of the time-frame, since it is a process that happens before the market phase. Plan/Forecast In this phase the System Operators take into account the utilization of their grid. Based on forecasts the Systems Operators checks the power flows to detect whether or not there will be possible congestion in the network. In case the grid capacity is insufficient to meet the forecasted electricity production or consumption, System Operators may resort to the flexibility market to resolve this type of issue. This phase is done for two different timeframes, day-ahead and intraday. On the one hand, the day-ahead forecasts are made for D-1. On the other hand, the intraday forecasts are made every 4 hours in order to improve the accuracy of the predicted flow of electricity that were made for the day-ahead. The objectives of this phase are to identify possible congestions in the network and to support the procurement in the flexibility markets. Market Phase The market phase starts after the system operators forecast network congestion. In this phase, the system operators are focused on collecting and selecting bids from FSPs. These bids can be in the day-ahead market, which occurs on D-1, in the intraday market, which occurs already inside D every 4 hours, or they can come from the long-term market (BUC-2). The intraday market is a complement to the day-ahead market. The possible failures or unforeseen events that were not covered in the day-ahead should be corrected in the intraday market. In the bid selection process, the SO should pay attention to whether the bid is located in its own network, or in another network. In the latter case, the SO should consult the SO where the bid is located so it can evaluate the constraints that may arise if the bid is accepted and activated. After this phase, the need arises to sort the accepted bids by a merit order list. This Business Use Case will address a multi-level market model. Monitoring and Activation This phase occurs after the list of bids sorted by a merit order is defined. The SO selects the bid it wants to activate, if the bid is located in the network of another SO, the latter should be consulted to validate the activation of this bid. If the SO’s need is not resolved this process is repeated iteratively until the SO needs are solved.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nFlexible resources connected to transmission and distribution system can provide flexibility to system operators to eliminate congestions through a market mechanism. This BUC describes the exchanges of information and the rules that should be established between DSO and TSO in case of forecasted congestions in transmission and distribution system in order to keep power flows in the accepted thermal limits of the lines. DSOs and TSOs should procure flexibility in advance to solve a specific system loading issue on the distribution and transmission system thus deferring/eliminating the need for traditional system upgrades. This kind of flexibility service can also be used to support the network during planned maintenance actions. These exchanges of information mechanisms should be compatible with any future market model or governance issues. The market timeframe that will be examined is more than annually. For this timeframe, we will approach some of the process phases of ASM report:\n Prepare/Pre-qualification: The process in which it is checked whether a unit can deliver the product it intends to sell, taking into account the network conditions. Plan/Forecast: Planning of grid utilization and identifying potential congestions. Market Phase: Bids collection and evaluation, long-term contracts (availability or capacity products) and long-term products/services (activation of energy products) Monitoring and Activation: Grid monitoring and flexibility bids activation of bids for congestion management Measurement and settlement phase: Validation of delivery This Business Case is related to BUC-1, since the phases that will be covered are the same, but in a different time frame. Although some of the phases may be similar for both Use Cases, others will have to be adapted. In this Business Use Case, the measurement and settlement phase will not be addressed.  Complete description\nFlexible resources connected to transmission and distribution system can provide flexibility to system operators to eliminate congestions through a market mechanism.\nThis BUC describes the exchanges of information and the processes that should be established for different scenarios: pre-qualification, plan/forecast, market phase and monitoring and activation phase. For each scenario, we will always take into account the more than annually timeframe.\nPre-qualification\nThe pre-qualification process should start after a flexibility service provider expresses interest in entering the flexibility market. This process serves to ensure that a particular flexibility service provider is capable of delivering a given product. In order to do that, two types of pre-qualification should be considered: Product Pre-qualification and Grid Pre-qualification.\nThe former ensures that the resource contains the technical requirements to be able to deliver the product and proceed to the market phase and eventually selected by a system operator. These technical requirements are defined by DSO and TSO and after the FSP indicates the attributes of the product it wants to deliver, a pre-qualification test should be performed to verify that all attributes are in compliance with the technical requirements. This test may be repeated on a periodic basis or whenever the characteristics of the product are found to change significantly.\nThe product pre-qualification can be done either by the DSO or TSO, regardless of its location. In case a system operator wants to activate a product already pre-qualified by another system operator, the former should have access to this information in order to make the process more efficient and not to pre-qualify the same product twice.\nRegarding grid pre-qualification, this process ensures that the product provided by the Flexible Service Provider will not cause constraints in the networks where it is connected. This process can be avoided if the System Operators have already identified the areas where flexibility is always allowed. The grid pre-qualification should be performed by the System Operator of the network to which the product is connected in order to verify if the maximum capacity of the product does not impact the network it is connected to.\nIf the results of the two types of pre-qualification are approved, the entry of the FSP into the flexibility market is allowed.\nThe Pre-qualification scenario is independent of the time-frame, since it is a process that happens before the market phase. Plan/Forecast In this phase the System Operators consider the planning of grid reinforcement to solve unexpected or forecasted physical congestions related to reduced network capacity. In case the grid capacity is insufficient to meet the forecasted electricity production or consumption, System Operators should find solutions to tackle these kind of needs and may resort to the flexibility. This planning occurs 1 to 3 years in advance and the use of flexibility should be considered as a complement or even an alternative to traditional grid investments. The objectives of this phase are to identify possible congestions in the network and to support the procurement in the flexibility markets. Market Phase The market phase starts when the system operators forecast network congestion. For long-term timeframe this phase is divided into two stages.\n The SO evaluates the bids and establishes agreements to reserve and activate, or just to reserve, the products that meet its needs. In the short-term market (BUC-1), these products, once reserved, can be activated in order to solve SO needs. In the bid selection process, the SO should pay attention to whether the bid is located in its own network, or in another network. In the latter case, the SO should consult the SO where the bid is located so it can evaluate the constraints that may arise if the bid is accepted and activated. After this phase, the need arises to sort the accepted bids by a merit order list. This Business Use Case will address a multi-level market model.\nMonitoring and Activation This phase occurs after the list of bids sorted by a merit order is defined. The SO selects the bid it wants to activate, if the bid is located in the network of another SO, the latter should be consulted to validate the activation of this bid. If the SO’s need is not resolved this process is repeated iteratively until the SO needs are solved.  1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope This BUC is focused on defining and describing the TSO and DSO information exchange, aiming to improve and facilitate long-term to short-term operational planning for both networks.   Objective(s) 1-Identify the scheduled/forecasted information exchanged between DSO and TSO in order to improve programming of DSO operation.    2-Identify the scheduled/forecasted information exchanged between DSO and TSO in order to improve programming of TSO operation.\n3-Anticipate and solve distribution grid constraints.\n4-Anticipate and solve transmission grid constraints.\n5-Develop information exchange mechanisms to share the identified information. | | Related business case(s) | This BUC 3 defines some information exchanges with the objective of enhance operational planning activities of the TSO and DSO, namely in what concerns to the use of flexibility for the Congestion Management (described in WECL-PT-01 and WECL-PT-02). |\n1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis BUC focus on the enhancement of information exchange that enables better operational planning for DSOs and TSOs.\nComplete description\nThe increase in generation from renewable resources, with its uncertainty, and the increase in the use of electricity (due to EVs for example) means that system operators have to improve their strategies for managing the grid more efficiently in order to avoid unnecessary investments. In this BUC, our strategy is to optimize coordination between DSO and TSO by identifying and sharing the information that enables better operational planning for their networks. This Business Case is related to BUC-1 and BUC-2, since some of the information covered in this use case can be used in both. This UC explores and intends to define the information exchange principles between TSO and DSO in order to improve the operation of both networks, in multiple domains and timeframes.\nFor the long term, will be defined the information that needs to be exchanged bidirectionally regarding the expected evolution of the transmission and distribution grids and their associated supply, consumption, production and flexibility services configuration.\nConcerning the medium term, the effort will be focused on the definition of the information regarding the capacity and availability for load connection in the EHV/HV substation, as well as the information regarding the load transfers availability between EHV/HV interconnecting points, providing a better management of the distribution network loops by the DSO. This allows, in case of emergency, the possibility of the DSO to manage the transfer of load between networks.\nFor the efficient use of the flexibility services and enhancement of the operational planning, the increase of the information exchanged on short-term is key. Once well-defined the observability area of both operators around the TSO-DSO border, the focus will be in the definition of information to exchange about:\n-Short-circuit power at the TSO-DSO border;\n-Scheduled maintenance actions in the observability area\n-Aggregated consumption and production forecast by technology (solar, wind, hydro, etc)\nThe short-circuit power at the HV bay in the physical border of the TSO-DSO interface (EHV/HV substations) is important to keep tracking due to the increase of the DER that actively contribute to the increase of the short-circuit levels. The short-circuit levels should be tracked in order to ensure that they are kept bellow the rated short circuit current of the circuit breakers in the interface TSO/DSO. This information should be computed and exchanged after the gate-closure time of the day-ahead market in order to use the market results to robustly forecast the short-circuit levels at nodal level in the observability area.\nDue to the impact that distribution network loops, close to the TSO-DSO interface, can have in the transmission power flows, the share of the information about the scheduled maintenance plans becomes crucial for the TSO operational planning. On the other side, to the DSO, the TSO can share information about the connectivity status and maintenance plans of the transmission lines between EHV/HV substation with some impact in the distribution grids power flows near the border.\nFor an efficient and secure operation of the power system, it is fundamental to include an accurate forecast of the load and generation into the TSO operational planning framework. Having in mind that the DSO has their own forecasting methods for the DERs generation and load connected to the distribution networks. Both forecasts can be aggregated by technology and per grid node of the observability area. This information, when shared with the TSO, can have great potential to enhance the TSO operational planning activities\nThe final goal of this use case is to set a greater cooperation in information exchanges between TSO-DSO within a common observability area for operational planning purposes and identify future flexibility needs in the transmission and distribution networks.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nDue to excessive and increasing energy consumption, existing MV/LV secondary substations occasionally becomes thermally overloaded and power lines congested. Demand response services can be utilised to decrease duration or even prevent overloads of the distribution grid components. In particular, switching of the heat pumps in one substation area can be used to reduce the transformer load during peak hours. In regard how DSO procure this flexibility service, two scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, service provider (e.g. aggregator) enters into a contract with DSO for a long-term period. The second scenario assumes that local flexibility market exists and that DSO purchases flexibility service at the local flexibility market to resolve congestion problems in the distribution grid.\nComplete description\nIn this BUC, DSO uses flexibility resources connected to the distribution grid to resolve congestion problem and postpone investment in the grid reinforcement. Depending on how local flexibility market is organised, two scenarios are considered.The first scenario corresponds to over the counter market (OCM) in which flexibility service provider (FSP) make a long-term (e.g. 6 months) bilateral contract with DSO related. This first scenario includes the following processes:· Prequalification: after DSO publishes a call for flexibility procurement, FSP sends a request for prequalification. Within this process, DSO evaluates technical info and optionally run tests (depending on the offered power and impact on the distribution grid) to confirm capability of FSP to deliver a service.· Offering: when DSO identifies a need for the flexibility, DSO sends requests for offers. FSP send an offer. DSO collects and ranks the offer. After selection of the best offer, contract is signed.· Activation: when congestion in the grid is predicted or occurred, DSO sends a request to FSP for contracted flexibility at a given location in the distribution grid. FSP acknowledges request and activates a service (e.g. reduces a consumption by switching off heat pumps).· Settlement: using calculated base line, volume of the delivered power is calculated. This is volume is confirmed by both sides (e.g. check of error in measurements) and invoice is sent.In the second scenario, DSO procures flexibility on the organised local flexibility market. This scenario includes the following processes:· Grid prequalification: at the start of this process, flexibility resources are registered at the flexibility register. Flexibility register (component located at the market operator) initiates prequalification of the registered resource run by DSO, to validate existence of the resource and it’s impact on the distribution grid. The complexity of this procedure depends on the volume/power and the impact on the grid of the flexibility resources.· Product prequalification: DSO defines the requirements that each local flexibility product should meet. Flexibility market operator (FMO) coordinates the prequalification process. Flexibility service provider sends the prequalification request with accompanying information to the FMO, who forwards this request to DSO. DSO runs predefined tests and calculation, after send the results and acknowledge FMO about the final decision. FMO stores this information to the flexibility register and acknowledges FSP · Bidding: DSO expresses the need for the flexibility service to FMO (based on the load and distributed generation prediction and state of the distribution grid), which publishes request for bids. FMO collects the bids from flexibility service provides and selects the optimal bids. FMO sends information about selected bids to DSO, flexibility service provider, TSO and flexibility register.· Activation: For the selected bid, activation is initiated by DSO sending activation signal to the flexibility service provider. FSP internally activates flexibility resources and acknowledges DSO. DSO informs TSO about activated flexibility resources in the distribution grid in order to avoid collision and double activation on the balancing market. During the activation, flexibility register (component of the market operator) collects the measurements from DSO and FSP.Settlement: Flexibility register calculates the base line. After the activated product has been delivered, flexibility register calculates delivered volume and information to DSO and FSP. In the process of volume validation, DSO and FSP should validate delivered volume. When volume can’t be validated, alignment process is initiated. FMO monetizes the delivered flexibility product and send the bill to DSO and reimbursement to FSP.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis use case defines information exchanges between TSO, DSO, Flexibility Operators and Market Operator necessary for procurement of flexibility provided by distributed energy resources. \u003cbr/\u003eFlexibility Operator interacts both with TSO and DSO and it is necessary to validate coordination mechanism that will prevent double activation of the same service at the same time. TSO and DSO should also collaborate in order to avoid negative impact of DFR (Distributed Flexibility Resource) activation on their respective networks.\u003cbr/\u003eThree main scenarios should be considered:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Flexibility Operator provides services for the TSO (national flexibility market) and the DSO should validate, in day-ahead or intraday timeframes, the activation of these flexibilities (for the resources connected in distribution network)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Flexibility Operator provides services for the DSO (local flexibility market). The DSO should provide, in day-ahead, the forecast load/generation for each primary substation including the activation of the procured flexibilities. The TSO should take into account this information for the balancing and congestion detection proposes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Flexibility Operator connected to distribution network provides services for the both for TSO and DSO in a coordinated local and national market mechanism. The offers not accepted in the local market are sent to the national market. At national market the TSO can obtain flexibilities from the Flexibility Operators connected on transmission and distribution networks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Flexibility Operator provides services for the both for TSO and DSO in a single procurement platform (single market). The activation of the offers should be agreed both by TSO and DSO.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\nComplete description\nFlexibility services can be used at the electricity market for the three types of actions: - portfolio optimisation of market players - constraints management in transmission and distribution networks (at day-ahead and intraday markets)- balancing to ensure power system security (balancing market). Enabling flexibility services must not lead to market fragmentation or competition distortion. However, settlement of constraint management and balancing must be clearly separated. DFR providers must be able to sell their services to both TSOs and DSOs. TSO procures flexibility services, from large industrial consumers or aggregators. DSO procures flexibilities also from aggregators and from several types of DERs (distributed generation, demand response, decentralized storage, electric vehicles) connected to the distribution grid with the purpose to maintain quality of service and the security of supply. DSO can procure flexibility services in long and short timescales. In the present BUC, the timeframes day-ahead and intraday are considered. Coordination between TSO and DSO is needed since the same flexibility resources may be activated for balancing (TSO services) and congestion constraints management (TSO and DSO services) purposes. Scenario 1: TSO procures the flexibilities and the DSO should validate their activationDFR are procured by TSO for the purpose of balancing or constraint management in the transmission grid. However, the activation of the flexibilities can jeopardizes the security of supply and reduces quality of services due to, for example, power line congestions, voltage constraints or overload the power transformer at TSO/DSO border. Since the DFR are connected to distribution network, DSO should be asked to validate the DFRs procured by the TSO to avoid constraints in the distribution system.Scenario 2: DSO procures the flexibilities and provides the forecasted load/generation by primary substationDSO can organises a local procurement of flexibilities to prevent the operation constraints in the distribution network. The constraints can be technical (HV/MV power transformer overload, lines congestion, voltage constraints) but also contractual (agreements between TSO/DSO in the TSO/DSO borders). Since the procurement of the DFR will impact the global system operation, the DSO should include the activation of the flexibility offers in the forecasts (load/generation by primary substation) sent to the TSO in day-ahead.Scenario 3: Coordination mechanism between local and national marketThe Flexible Operators connected in distribution network should place their offer in a local market and the Flexible Operators connected in the transmission network should place their orders in a national market. The clearing mechanism in local market should provide services for the DSO to solve the distribution network constraints. The offers that are not used in the local market should be technically validated by the DSO and be transferred for the National market. After the clearing process both in local and national markets, the TSO should coordinate the activation of the flexibilities connected in the transmission system and the DSO should coordinate the activation of the flexibilities connected in the distribution network.Scenario 4: TSO and DSO procure flexibility in a single flexibility marketTo ensure the market liquidity, building a level playing field for different service providers in a single marketplace and to joint procurement of services both for TSOs and DSOs a single procurement system is needed [1]. In this single procurement platform (market) the TSO and the DSOs should include their needs to balancing and congestion management (TSO) and for congestion and voltage management (DSO). It is important to mention that some voltage constraints can appear in distribution network even if a good reactive management is implemented.Flexibility platform enables well-structured and organised exchange of data between TSO, DSO and flexibility service provider. DSO should have visibility of aggregated resources in the distribution grid and information about individual activations. This information should be available (day ahead or intraday time frames) to ensure that market schedules are not in the conflict with network operation. \n1.5.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Market Operator Business The unique power exchange of trades for the actual delivery of energy that receives the bids from the parties that have a contract to bid. The market operator determines the market energy price for the market balance area after applying technical constraints from the system operator. It may also establish the price for the reconciliation within a metering grid area.    Flexibility Operator Business Role which links through contractual agreements (flexibility requests, notices etc.) the role customer and its possibility to provide flexibilities to the roles market and grid; generic role that could be taken by many stakeholders. This entity can activate all or part of the flexibility resources during a period and regarding a specific location or geographical area.    Distribution System Operator Business A natural or legal person responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of and, if necessary, developing the distribution system in a given area and, where applicable, its interconnections with other systems and for ensuring the long term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the distribution of electricity or gas. That definition is provided for by art. 2 n. 6 Dir 2007/72/EC with regards to electricity and by art. 2 (6) Dir 2007/73/EC with regards to gas.In the electricity sector distribution means the transport of electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution systems with a view to its delivery to customers, but does not include supply according to art. 2 (5) Dir, 2007/72/EC. Accordingly, distribution in the gas sector means the transport of natural gas through regional pipeline networks with a view to its delivery to customers, but not including supply.DSOs have to act according to art. 25, 26, 27 Dir. 2007/72/EC (with regards to electricity) and to art. 25, 26, 27 Dir. 2007/73/EC (with regards to gas). The aforementioned provisions provide the tasks and duties of DSOs.One of the main characteristics of the DSO is that it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision making from other activities not relating to distribution within a vertically integrated undertaking. Unlike the transmission system operator, the DSO is not affected by ownership unbundling.    Transmission System Operator Business According to the Article 2.4 of the Electricity Directive 2009/72/EC (Directive): \"a natural or legal person responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of and, if necessary, developing the transmission system in a given area and, where applicable, its interconnections with other systems, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity\". Moreover, the TSO is responsible for connection of all grid users at the transmission level and connection of the DSOs within the TSO control area.Source : EU Commission Task Force for Smart Grids, EG3     3.2.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis SUC describes the process to define the exchange of signal/information (measurements, states, … ) between the TSOs and DSOs. Two scenarios are described: one to send the real-time information and another to request the real-time information.\nComplete description\nThe exchange of real-time information between TSO and DSO is essential to real-time control and supervision of the power system. Although it is a usual practice between transmission and distribution operators, it should be revised and improved given the importance that has in the operation of both grids.The definition of the standardized method to request and send measurements along with setting up a methodology to define the right observability areas of both TSO and DSO at each other networks and by expanding the set of signals (measurements, states …) exchanged are some of the enhancements that this SUC provides.In the case of Portuguese field test, the exchange of real-time information will use Inter-Control center Communication Protocol (ICCP) in order to allow the communication between TSO and DSO SCADAs. However, other solutions can be adopted.\n1.5.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Data exchange platform System Platform used by several power system actors to exchange information for different proposes. Three types of data (real-time, scheduled and structural data) can be exchanged through this platform. The operational/control data are not included in real-time type. The exchange of information related with the markets are included in the scheduled data.The platform is a data-agnostic ICT infrastructure that enables a secure and reliable information exchange for different purposes (long-term planning, operational planning, contingencies, …) and within different time scales.    Network Operation System The Network Operation function includes business activity directly involved with monitoring and operating the power grid as a whole system. The phrase ‘directly involved’ indicates that the covered activities are limited to a hands-on focus on keeping the power grid running successfully, and more indirect influences on grid operation, such as energy markets, will be covered by other business functions.The phrase ‘as a whole system’ indicates that local activity, such as operating a generating plant or substation, is excluded, and here the concern is a system perspective, such as is typical in transmission or distribution control centres.In the presented SUCs, the Network Operation function can refer to either the analysis tools used by TSOs or DSOs.     3.2.

Foreign Customer Portal System Customer Portal for another country.Can also mean a separate portal in the same country.    Customer Portal System Customer Portal manages data users' authentication, access permissions and data logs. Customer Portals store data related to its services (e.g. authentication information, representation rights, access permissions, data logs).    Data Exchange Platform System Data exchange platform (DEP) is a communication platform the basic functionality of which is to secure data transfer (routing) from data providers (e.g. data hubs, flexibility service providers, TSOs, DSOs) to the data users (e.g. TSOs, DSOs, consumers, suppliers, energy service providers). DEP stores data related to its services (e.g. cryptographic hash of the data requested). The DEP does not store core energy data (e.g. meter data, grid data, market data) while these data can be stored by data hubs. Several DEPs may exist in different countries and inside one country.    DEP Operator Business Data exchange platform operator owns and operates a communication system which basic functionality is data transfer.     3.2.

Related business case(s)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nNowadays the operation of MV networks creates new challenges for automation. Coupling this with the worldwide economic situation, efforts for reaching a balance between Quality of Service indexes and investments in automation and grid reinforcement through simplify methods are worthy. This Use Case describes this process.\nComplete description\nWhy? Requirements for increasing the level of automation in actual MV networks are rising currently. The relation between investment in automation and Quality of Service it is not linear. For example, the location of the same number of devices could lead to a variety of costs as well. Moreover, initial investment plans might be not affordable due to the actual economic crisis. Therefore, a simulation program to evaluate different scenarios is proposed to select a compromised point between costs, number of equipment and propose criterion to locate them. What expectation? / When It is expected a definition of a methodology to decide the level of automation in MV grids in a simplify manner. It would be based on a simulation algorithm taking into account investment on equipment in different types of SS and lines, power reinforcements and evaluation of their impact on the Quality of Service (TIEPI). It is intended to facilitate decisions during the network planning phase fulfilling technical, cost and regulatory constraints. What occurs? The main three steps in the process are: Use average values of outages (for example rate of outages in SS, lines, cables…) and cost units of work to install telecontrol equipment (cabinet at SS and breakers at lines) to increase the automation of the network. These data are managed by the DSO after analysing historical records collected in their systems.

General remarks    General remarks     The hypotheses/conditions under which the Use Case is developed are the following: The analysed MV network area is divided in small sections. These sub-sections are selected between two consecutive automatic Secondary Substations (SS). A simplified MV network representation is required in PSS/E to simulate each outage scenario (power flow calculations) Average rates of outages are needed to know the network performance of each area to identified critical zones. These values would be for example per SS (outage/100SS/year), underground lines (outages/100km/year) and aerial lines (outages/100km/year). Regulatory values are used to decide objective targets for simulation (penalties due to QoS). Through the results (graph of QoS vs Investment) a criterion of location for pieces of control equipment (automatic cabinets and telecontrol breakers at lines) is proposed. The proposed level of automation is taking into account by the responsible of each control zone to install the equipment. In Spain the Distribution of electricity is a regulated activity. The remuneration of DSO is charged on customers through the Access Tariffs. This tax joins different concepts. One of them is devoted to cover, theoretically, the distribution activity. The value is decided by the Ministry. From 2008, all DSO are subjected to the same procedure and legal conditions. The remuneration is individually assigned to each DSO taking into account issues such as: incentives per Quality of Service improvements, incentives to reduce the losses, valuation of overcast, effects to cover the foreseen demand and geographical restrictions. Each four (4) year the base value is fixed while yearly some parameters are corrected depending on the DSO performance. The architecture developed in the following section corresponds to the Use Case implementation within a DSO system architecture. However, in the PRICE pilot the approach has been simpler.    2.

Actors    Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case     Network Operation Statistics and Reporting  This actor makes it possible to archive on-line data and to perform feedback analysis about system efficiency and reliability. In the pilot this actor represents the fact of having already average ratios of outages. One possible way to get these values is to analyse historical outages tickets (normally in the DMS- Distribution Management Systems) where information about the outages are stored (start/end times, equipment that failed, power shortage, number of client affected…)   Network Operation Simulation  This actor performs network simulations in order to allow facilities to define, prepare and optimise the sequence of operations required for carrying out maintenance work on the system (release/clearance orders) and operational planning. In the pilot this actor represents the fact of performing simulations with electrical tools. These analyses consist on evaluating scenarios with different level of automation.   Asset Investment Planning  Asset investment planning involves strategy definition and prioritisation, maintenance strategy planning, risk management, programme management and decision-making. It drives the condition, configuration, performance, operating costs, and flexibility of the asset base, with the aim of maximising value. In the pilot this actor represents the process of analysing the result of the simulation (a curve of QoS vs Investment)    3.2.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Übergeordnetes Ziel des Hauptarbeitspakets ist es, die Nutzung vorhandener Standards im Projekt durch Bereitstellung von Methodenwissen und Software-Werkzeugen zu fördern und die Projektergebnisse zur Weiterentwicklung von Standards aufzubereiten. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt wird dabei auf das Thema Informationssicherheit inkl. IT-Sicherheit und Datensicherheit sowie den Datenschutz gelegt.\nIn diesem Use Case geht es zum einen um die einheitliche Darstellung aller Use Cases des Projektes enera mit Hilfe des Use Case Tempates, deren Sammlung, Verknüpfung und Konsolidierung untereinander sowie der Bereitstellung für weitere Arbeiten durch ein Use Case Management Repository (UCMR). Zum anderen wird soll aufbauend auf den Use Cases eine Gesamtübersicht über das Projekt enera als Architekturdokumentation im Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) entstehen.\n   Objective(s) Use Cases erfassen Use Cases im UCMR sammeln Bereitstellung Use Cases Pflege Use Cases Erstellung SGAM Komponentenebene Erstellung SGAM Gesamtarchitekur   Related business case(s)     1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nDie konzeptionellen Aktivitäten in enera werden durch die Erstellung von Anforderungs- und Architekturmodellen zusammengeführt. Dabei werden nationale und internationale Standards und technische Richtlinien (u. a. von DKE, IEC, ISO, IEEE, BSI) und gesetzliche Vorgaben berücksichtigt.\nDas Ziel dieses Use Cases ist die Architekturdokumentation nach SGAM inkl. eines Repositorys mit den enera Anwendungsfällen gemäß IEC 62559. Dies lässt sich in drei Teile untergliedern:\n Erstellung der enera Anwendungsfälle gemäß IEC 62559 Sammlung der Anwendungsfälle in einem Repository Erstellung der Gesamtarchitektur im SGAM  Complete description\nDas IEC 62559-2 Use Case Template dient der einheitlichen Beschreibung von Anforderungen an Smart Grid-Systemen. Das Template wird mittlerweile auf andere Systeme wie z.B. Ambient Assisted Living und Electrical Vehicles adaptiert und zeigt damit, dass es auch für andere Systeme ohne große Anpassungen verwendet werden kann. Basierend auf dem Use Case lassen sich Architekturmodelle (wie z.B. SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model) und EMAM (Electric Mobility Architecture Model)) erstellen, die für die weitere Entwicklung eines Systems relevant sind und damit einen Schritt nach der Anforderungsbeschreibung mittels Use Cases darstellen.\nDas Use Case Management Repository (UCMR) ist eine beim OFFIS entwickelte Webapplikation für die Erstellung, das Management und den Austausch von Use Cases sowie weiteren zugehörigen Daten wie Architekturmodelle, Akteurs- und Anforderungsbibliotheken. Zur Strukturierung der Inhalte von Use Cases wird eine Baumstruktur zur Visualisierung angewandt, die derzeit in vier Ordner unterteilt ist: Use Cases, Actors (Akteure), Functions (Funktionen) und Requirements (Anforderungen). Der Use Case Ordner zeigt die Use Cases, die von den Nutzern erstellt wurden. Jeder Use Case kann in einem eigenen Tab geöffnet werden und seine Szenarien und Szenarioschritte werden im Baum angezeigt. Die Elemente des Actors-, Functions- und Requirements-Ordners können ebenfalls in Tabs geöffnet werden; Zusätzlich können diese Elemente im Baum sortiert und verlinkt werden. Der Vorteil dieser Ordnerstruktur ist die Wiederverwendung von Elementen, beispielsweise kann ein Akteur einmalig definiert und dann in mehreren Use Cases verwendet werden.\nDas Smart Grid Architektur Modell (SGAM), das im Rahmen der Bearbeitung des EU-Mandats M/490 entwickelt wurde, dient der Konzeptualisierung von Smart Grids. Es erlaubt die Prüfung von Smart Grid Anwendungsfällen und deren Unterstützung durch Standards. So kann die Unterstützung von Anwendungsfällen durch die SGAM-Methodik verifiziert beziehungsweise Lücken identifiziert werden. Mit dem Modell kann der aktuelle Stand einer Implementierung im elektrischen Netz dargestellt werden, wobei die Smart Grid Anwendungsfälle aus architektonischer Sicht betrachtet werden und das SGAM spezifisch und neutral in Hinblick auf Umsetzung und Technologie ist. Darüber hinaus kann die Entwicklung hin zu zukünftigen Smart Grid Szenarios geschildert werden, da das Modell den Prinzipien der Universalität, Lokalisierung, Konsistenz, Flexibilität, Skalierbarkeit, Erweiterbarkeit und Interoperabilität folgt. Das SGAM wird auf drei Achsen beschrieben. Bei der Modellierung wird auf fünf Interoperabilitätsebenen jeweils die Smart Grid Fläche abgedeckt, die durch die elektrischen Domänen mit der klassischen Energieflusskette und die Zonen des Energiemanagements mit der hierarchischen Struktur aufgespannt wird.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope A local energy community - With the new Clean Energy Package, private households are encouraged not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical developments and grid fee mechanisms canmotivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly large installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency up to 100%.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) -\tMaximize consumption of local generation/Minimize demand satisfied by public grid  -\tIslanding of local grid by making use of flexible loads and storages  -\tMaximizing duration of islanding operation -\tUC 1 is prerequisite for UC 2 to 4   Related business case(s) no    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe use case “Islanding” of an energy community aims to balance generation and demand of a local energy community in such a way that the load flow across the connecting MV/LV transformer is reduced to a minimum. The balancing is enabled by an energy management systems called Avacon Local Flex Controller (ALF-C). The ALF-C monitors the power flow across the transformer and controls a battery energy storage system (BESS) connected directly to the LV-terminal of the substation. Generated energy surplus will be stored in the BESS and released at times of a generation deficit. Private households equipped with batteries and controllable electric heaters can be dispatched to increase the degree of self-sufficiency further.\nComplete description\nThe Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, encourages private households are not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share self-generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical development and grid fee mechanisms can motivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. This will lead to a change in the behaviors of electrical energy exchange along the grid connection point of the MV/LV grid and consequently load flows along the MV-lines. A local Energy Management System (EMS) named (Avacon Local Flex Controller –( ALF-C) will monitor local generation, demand and storage capacities and control available flexibilities in such a way that consumption of locally generated energy will be maximized. When local generation exceeds local demand, surplus energy will automatically be stored in local storages and the consumption of available flexible loads will be increased. When local consumption is exceeding local generation, stored electrical energy in local batteries will be discharged. The target is to minimize the load flow exchange at the MV/LV grid connection to a level at which the community is virtually islanded. In cases where generation and demand can not be balanced due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the residual load will exported/imported. A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases between the medium voltage and low voltage grid. The measured values indicate the residual demand or export of surplus of generated energy/power. Data is provided to the EMS an based on the information increases or decreases the load in order balance the grid. Additionally, customer households provide flexible load and storage capacities for steering. Flexible assets in the field are equipped with sensors and controllers for steering to increase or decrease demand and to command charging or discharging of local large Battery Energy Storage System and private customer household storages. Vendors of flexible assets provide a cloud data management platform from which measurement data are accessible for EMS via an backend. The interface also provides data to sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and provide the necessary data for EMS to estimate the state of charge of batteries or flexible loads and potential available storage capacity. With Hhistorical measurement data and weather forecasts provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize self-sufficiency. Controllers Actuators enable EMSC to switch on and off, increase or decrease energy consumption of individual loads, such as storage heaters and heat pumps, and storages located in private households and the large scale storage located in the community. The communication between sensors, actuators controllers and EMSC will be web based, via LTE or DSL and open protocols. Customers shall not sacrifice comfort due to a decrease of room heating. The operation of the community in an “Island” mode will be initiated by the operator.\n1.5.

Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration.   Related business case(s) Integration of local energy communities in network management strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the community to provide flexibility to third parties – driven by technical circumstances or following economic considerations (market incentives). Use Case 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant non-zero power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.\nComplete description\nThe community is consuming and/or generating energy. A user (in the case of the field trial the DSO) triggers the EMS to apply Use Case 2 and sets a target value (P’Breaker) for the power exchange at the grid connection. The EMS (ALF-C) processes weather forecasts and measurement values from the grid connection and flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads located in the community. Based on the data and historic values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach (P’Breaker) by utilizing the available flexibility to keep the power flow constant for a pre-defined duration.  The EMS communicates with sensors through the Blockchain Access Platform and DSO Technical Platform and handles all data in a dedicated data base. The DSO Technical Platform provides encryption and decryption in the whole IT infrastructure. Control signals are routed through the DSO technical platform and the Blockchain Access Platform to flexible devices, if applicable through a third-party backend that connects to the hardware.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Energy communities with a high proportion of self-generation and flexible consumers and storage can maximize the self-consumption of locally generated energy. These communities are unlikely to meet their own needs with locally generated energy throughout the year and will potentially run into energy-deficit in times of low local generation. Energy deficits could be compensated by the supplying distribution network. To reduce the stress on the mid-voltage feeder and reduce overall network cost, energy deficits occurring could be forecasted and delivered in discrete packages ahead of time at fixed time slots and be stored in local storages until demand arises.  Networks: LV, MV  Markets: None   Objective(s) •\tEnabling temporary islanding even in times of energy deficit of the local community  •\tForecasting of residual energy demand of an energy community  •\tCalculation of required energy packages serving energy deficits  •\tDetermination of power exchange schedule for the energy community for the grid connection point LV/MV (time and power of load exchange)  •\tDetermination of a setpoint schedule for individual local asset to meet energy community setpoint schedule  •\tExecution of defined power exchange between energy community and the distribution network   Related business case(s) Integration of local energy communities in network management and supply strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid    Notes:\n  Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.\n  Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.\n  Realted business case(s) - optional\n  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).  In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur, they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising. Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.\nComplete description\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.  Networks: LV, MV  Markets: None   Objective(s) Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).  In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When generation of surplus occur, they must be exported into the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy export to the connected distribution network, energy surplus could be forecast and exported delayed as an energy package within a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point. The generated energy surplus first shall be stored in local storages located within the community and be exported as an energy package delayed, when the load in the upper grid decreases. Outside of the defined periods of energy export, no power exchange shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the export of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.

The schedule can be defined for a duration for the next 1 to 24 hours.  The schedule contains time slots for the export of energy in which P’Breaker ≠ 0 and time slots in which no power shall be exchange along the grid connection point (P’Breaker = 0), following the principle of UC 1. During the application of UC 4 the total amount of exported energy shall meet the total amount of the residual energy surplus that the community will generate. The generated surplus will therefore have to be forecasted by the user. In times P’Breaker = 0 the generated surplus will have to be stored in local battery energy storages systems. In times P’Breaker ≠ 0, local batteries will be triggered to discharge in order to export generated surplus from LV into MV grid. To maintain the given setpoint P’Breaker deficits shall be covered by energy provided by batteries located in the local network whereas generated surplus shall be buffered in available batteries.  After the user input has been confirmed the EMS begins with the application of UC 4. The EMS receives weather forecasts provided by an external service provider and measurement values provided by sensors located at the LV/MV grid connection point, flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads as well as household grid connection points. Based on the received data and historic measurements values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach and maintain the setpoint schedule by utilizing the available flexibility for the pre-defined duration.  A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases with the MV grid PBreaker and provide data to the EMS. Based on the information the EMS determines deviations between PBreaker and P’Breaker and dispatches setpoints to increases or decreases the load in the grid in order to reach P’Breaker. Additionally, sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and SOC/SOE of storages and provide data to the EMS. With historical measurement data and weather forecast provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize the duration of time of maintaining P’Breaker.  In cases generation and demand cannot be balanced to reach (P’Breaker) due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the use case will be terminated.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description The UC investigates the capability of the state estimation tool to filter the available measurement data, comprising actual measurements obtained from active metering devices and pseudo-measurements, i.e. data derived from load forecasting or RES scheduling for network observability accomplishment, in order to identify measurements with gross errors (bad data), to suppress measurement errors, to reconcile inconsistent data and, ultimately, to estimate the actual operational network state.\nComplete description The DSO operates the distribution network. A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA) installed throughout the network, is available for real-time operation purposes. The related measurements refer to power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is the integration of measurement data obtained from PMUs into the State Estimation tool.   Objective(s) * To reinforce network observability and controllability via improved state estimation performance. * To ensure smooth incorporation of synchronised measurement data derived from PMUs into the preexisting system of conventional measurements.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Measurement data obtained from the installed PMUs are integraded in the State Estimation tool and used to enhance the network observability. The installation of PMUs at selected buses is sure to upgrade the overall metering infrastructure of the network, since they record synchronized measurements of bus voltage phasors as well as a number of line current phasors—all of which are independent of each other and count as individual measurements. Yet, their proper utilization via the SE tool is a challenging task due to a) the intense discrepancies in update rates between conventional and PMU measurements, b) the provision of current measurements which often lead to various numerical problems, and c) the contrast between the large weighting factors linked to PMU measurements compared to the much lower ones linked to pseudo-measurements, which usually raises ill-conditioning issues. The goal is to ensure that the integration of PMU data will be smooth and all the aforesaid problems will be circumvented.\nComplete description A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA, PMUs) installed throughout the network, is available to the DSO for real-time operation purposes. The aforementioned data refer to a) synchronised measurements of bus voltage phasors and line current phasors (magnitude and angle) and b) conventional measurements of power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set, reconciles the PMU data with the conventional measurements, and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses. Given the successful integration and use of the PMU data in the SE tool, the overall performance of the SE tool will be enhanced; the network state will be calculated with increased precision compared to conventional-measurements-only scenarios (uc-GR-1), and high quality real-time operational standards for distribution management applications will be met.\n1.5.

State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the state vector that the state estimation tool produces using the available measurements and the topology data from the AMR, GIS, SCADA and PMUs. The DSO communicates network tariffs in a day-ahead context. These tariffs appropriately reflect the potential of the network exceeding its physical limits resulting in violations and/or curtailment of demand/generation. Compared to the business as usual scenario of the flat network tariffs, the DSO aims at reducing such negative effects by the use of variable day-ahead network tariffs, which incentivise the appropriate actions of the -assumed as- rational users of the distribution network.\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Related business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Various types of flexible loads -aggregated for the scope of the Use Case- react to network tariffs sent by the DSO, so that frequency restoration request from the TSO is adequately handled. More in detail, customers with flexible loads will respond to such requests and the DSO will use flexibility tools to coordinate their response aiming at achieving the frequency support objective while ensuring distribution network operational safety. As in the previous Use Cases the state of the system is provided by the state estimation tool.\nComplete description Customers with flexible loads are connected to the distribution network and their loads are considered aggregated for the scope of the UCs regarding their management in the MV level. State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the available measurements and the topology via the AMR, GIS and SCADA data. A frequency support activation request from the TSO arrives at the customers with flexible loads. The request is also communicated to the DSO technical platform via an API and the information is shared with the appropriate tools and services. The DSO calculated and communicated to the customers the appropriate network tariffs that reflect the situation of the network. The flexible loads react to these tariffs and respond to the frequency support request appropriately.\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is to examine the integration and operational use of low cost PMUs in order to increase network observability collecting measurement data such as voltage, current and phases in various points of the distribution network. More in detail, the DSO will use the data collected to improve the operation of the tools and services developed within the project by exploiting increased data granularity. Furthermore, the data coming from various sources and systems of the DSO should be integrated in the DSO Technical Platform having first passed through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to provide data access security and data integrity. In addition, all the available data should be further delivered for use by tools and services developed in order to support flexibility mechanisms. All the appropriate communication protocols should be integrated and tested to develop a unique point of data delivery to various actors involved in the project and a User Interface (UI) should be developed to allow the DSO personnel to use the available tools and services.

Narrative of Use Case Short description PMUs are installed in critical network nodes to increase network observability. PMU measurements along with other DSO data (network topology, customer loads, etc) are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform to be visulalised in a User Interface (UI), so that DSO can make use of tools and services developed in the project. Aforementioned data is going through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to ensure data access security and data integrity.\nComplete description\nThe DSO operates the distribution network and handles the data sources coming from various systems such as SCADA/DMS, AMR, GIS etc. Data coming from various sources get integrated into the Open DSO Technical Platform providing an adequate level of network observability. Low cost PMUs are deployed in Mesogia area in critical network points and nodes where there is limited observability or a requirement to have an increased awareness such as DER and prosumers bidirectional power flows. Also, PMU data are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform following a data collection plan that serves the functionalities of the flexibility tools and services. Measurements from PMUs enhance network awareness in terms of data granularity and number of nodes observed in a cost effective manner. Also, the open DSO Technical Platform performs the correlation of the data coming from different sources and systems during real time, providing to the DSO the technical capacity for flexibility mechanisms support and a User Interface (UI) where the aforementioned is visualised. All data is verified and secured by the use of blockchain technology to be developed in the Blockhain Access Platform of the project.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis use case describes the main steps to avoid voltage violations in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nComplete description\nThe Use Case describes the main steps to avoid voltage violations in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nIn the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n Detection of voltage violations on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions; Definition of voltage violations on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid; Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders. At this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market.\nThe same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility. For the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis use case describes the main steps to prevent congestion issues in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nComplete description\nThe Use Case describes the main steps to prevent congestion issues in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges In the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n  Detection of congestion issues on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions;\n  Definition of congestion issues on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid;\n  Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.\n  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders.\nAt this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market. The same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility.\nFor the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

Objective(s) This information is needed to perform correctly algorithms (State Estimation, State Forecasting, Optimal Power Flow, and control actions in order to increase the network reliability and performance.  Related business\ncase(s)      1.4 Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe data collection for the LV grid is performed storing real-time measurements (mean values and PQ indexes), states and alarms in a unique repository – located in the Secondary Substation – after managing some implementation issues, such as protocol conversion and writing of data into the SSAU.RDBMS.\n“Real-time” in this context means something in between 1 second and some minutes.\nComplete description\nOn the LV grid, several monitoring devices will be installed:\n Smart Meters (SM) on the connection point of LV customers/productions. Data of SMs are often collected by a Meter Data Collector (MDC) system, installed in the secondary substation and aggregated in an Automatic Metering Management system (AMM) located in the control center.   Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Power Quality Meters (PQMs) or – more in general – Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  Data considered by the use case is:\n  Mean values of V, I, Q, P:\n  LV busbars, LV side of transformers and LV lines in secondary substations (RTU, IED)\n  On the connection point of LV customers/productions (SM/MDC)\n    Load profiles from LV customers and generations (SM/MDC)\n  PQ indexes both from the secondary substations and from some relevant nodes of the LV grid, such has street cabinets (PQM)\n  Status of remote-controllable elements in secondary substations (RTU-IED)\n  breakers/disconnectors\n  tap changer of MV/LV transformers\n  voltage or reactive power set-points for generation connected on the LV network\n    Alarms related to events and faults (IED-PQM-RTU)\n  Measures, events and states not provided by those devices are provided by the Distribution Management System (DMS).\nMeasures, events and states from the MV side of the secondary substation should be considered as well. In that case they will be transfer to the primary substation by the DMS.\nMeasures are fetched by using:\n  the IEC61850 protocols (mainly MMS) and stored into the database which presents a data model compliant with the IEC61850 for the general monitoring of the LV grid (from RTUs, IEDs, DMS…)\n  DLMS/COSEM protocol for the communication with electronic meters(EM)\n   Protocol conversion have to be implemented before writing the data – collected from different sources – into the SSAU.RDBMS to enable the execution of other use cases.\nThe SSAU.RDBMS should contain a Data layer, composed by a relational database, where the data are written.\nThe SSAU.Monitoring must include an Interface layer which implements required communication protocols and which is able to extract data from other systems.\nThe SSAU.Reporting is composed of an Application layer, which analyses the data to:\n  calculate statistical values such as min, max, avg, std, etc.\n  generate reports for the primary substation/DMS\n  1.5 General Remarks 2 Diagrams of Use Case Diagram 1   Diagram 2   Diagram 3   -- 3 Technical Details 3.1 Actors   Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case    DIED.SM function Smart Meter (SM)\nDef. 1\nMeter with additional functionalities one of which is data communication.\nDef. 2\nThe metering end device is a combination of the following meter-related functions from the Smart Metering reference architecture: Metrology functions including the conventional meter display (register or index) that are under legal metrological control.

Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate. Level of depth - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used. Prioritisation - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand. Generic, regional or national relation - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur. Nature of the use cases - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like technical, political, business/market, test, etc.  1.8.

Step by Step Analysis of Use Case 4.1. Overview of Scenarios    No. Scenario Name Primary Actor Triggering Event Pre-Condition Post-Condition     1         Notes This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.\n Primary Actor - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin. Triggering Event - the incident causing the scenario to begin. Pre-Condition - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed. Post-Condition - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.  4.2.

The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.\n Event - Event triggering a step, specific for that use case. Name of Process/ Activity - general classification of process/activity (e.g. data aquisition). Description of Process/ Activity - more detailed description of the step. Service - addresses the nature of the information flow. Possible: GET (The information receiver obtains information from the information producer after an implicit request.), CREATE (The information producer creates an information object.), CHANGE (The information producer performs an update of the information at the information receiver’s.), DELETE (The information producer deletes information of the receiver.), CANCEL/CLOSE (A process is terminated.), EXECUTE (An action or service is performed.), REPORT (The information producer supplies information of its own account.), TIMER (The actor which represents both information producer and receiver has to enforce a waiting period.), REPEAT (A number of steps has to be repeated until a break condition (stated in the field Event) is satisfied. The contemplated steps have to be added in parentheses.). Information Producer and Receiver (Actor) - actors from actor list in section 3.1 Information exchanged (IDs) - ID of the information defined further in section 5  5. Information Exchanged    Information exchanged ID Name of Information Description of Information Exchanged Requirements to information data            Notes\n Information exchanged ID - unique number (I-01,I-02…) for identification Requirements to information data - optional, defined in section 6  6.
